<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>


<p>This Number closes the Third Volume of <span class="smcap">Harper's New Monthly Magazine</span>. In closing
the Second Volume the Publishers referred to the distinguished success which had attended
its establishment, as an incentive to further efforts to make it worthy the immense patronage
it had received:&mdash;they refer with confidence to the Contents of the present Volume, for
proof that their promise has been abundantly fulfilled.</p>

<p>The Magazine has reached its present enormous circulation, simply because it gives <i>a
greater amount of reading matter, of a higher quality, in better style, and at a cheaper price</i> than
any other periodical ever published. Knowing this to be the fact, the Publishers have spared,
and will hereafter spare, no labor or expense which will increase the value and interest of the
Magazine in all these respects. The outlay upon the present volume has been from five to
ten thousand dollars more than that upon either of its predecessors. The best talent of the
country has been engaged in writing and illustrating original articles for its pages:&mdash;its selections
have been made from a wider field and with increased care; its typographical appearance
has been rendered still more elegant; and several new departments have been added to
its original plan.</p>

<p>The Magazine now contains, regularly:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> One or more original articles upon some topic of historical or national interest, written
by some able and popular writer, and illustrated by from fifteen to thirty wood engravings,
executed in the highest style of art.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> Copious selections from the current periodical literature of the day, with tales of
the most distinguished authors, such as <span class="smcap">Dickens, Bulwer, Lever</span>, and others&mdash;chosen
always for their literary merit, popular interest, and general utility.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> A Monthly Record of the events of the day, foreign and domestic, prepared with
care and with the most perfect freedom from prejudice and partiality of every kind.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> Critical Notices of the Books of the Day, written with ability, candor, and spirit,
and designed to give the public a clear and reliable estimate of the important works constantly
issuing from the press.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> A Monthly Summary of European Intelligence, concerning books, authors, and whatever
else has interest and importance for the cultivated reader.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> An Editor's Table, in which some of the leading topics of the day will be discussed
with ability and independence.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i> An Editor's Easy Chair or Drawer, which will be devoted to literary and general
gossip, memoranda of the topics talked about in social circles, graphic sketches of the
most interesting minor matters of the day, anecdotes of literary men, sentences of interest
from papers not worth reprinting at length, and generally an agreeable and entertaining collection
of literary miscellany.</p>

<p>The object of the Publishers is to combine the greatest possible <span class="smcap">Variety</span> and <span class="smcap">Interest</span>,
with the greatest possible <span class="smcap">Utility</span>. Special care will always be exercised in admitting nothing
into the Magazine in the slightest degree offensive to the most sensitive delicacy; and
there will be a steady aim to exert a healthy moral and intellectual influence, by the most
attractive means.</p>

<p>For the very liberal patronage the Magazine has already received, and especially for the
universally flattering commendations of the Press, the Publishers desire to express their cordial
thanks, and to renew their assurances, that no effort shall be spared to render the work
still more acceptable and useful, and still more worthy of the encouragement it has received.</p>

Child of the sun, refulgent <span class="smcap">Summer</span> comes,<br />
In pride of youth, and felt through nature's depth:<br />

Averts her blushful face; and earth, and skies,<br />
All-smiling, to his hot dominion leaves.<br />

Where scarce a sunbeam wanders through the gloom<br />

Of haunted stream, that by the roots of oak<br />
Rolls o'er the rocky channel, lie at large,<br />
And sing the glories of the circling year.<br />

By mortal seldom found: may fancy dare,<br />
From thy fix'd serious eye, and raptur'd glance<br />
Shot on surrounding heaven, to steal one look<br />
Creative of the poet, every power<br />
Exalting to an ecstasy of soul.</p></div>

<span class="i1">And thou, my youthful muse's early friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whom the human graces all unite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure light of mind, and tenderness of heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Genius and wisdom; the gay social sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By decency chastis'd; goodness and wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In seldom-meeting harmony combin'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unblemish'd honor, and an active zeal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Britain's glory, liberty, and man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Dodington! attend my rural song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stoop to my theme, inspirit every line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And teach me to deserve thy just applause.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With what an awful world-revolving power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were first the unwieldy planets launch'd along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The illimitable void! thus to remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the flux of many thousand years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That oft has swept the toiling race of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all their labor'd monuments away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firm, unremitting, matchless, in their course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the kind-temper'd change of night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the Seasons ever stealing round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minutely faithful: such the All-perfect Hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pois'd, impels, and rules the steady whole.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When now no more the alternate Twins are fir'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cancer reddens with the solar blaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short is the doubtful empire of the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon, observant of approaching day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meek-ey'd morn appears, mother of dews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first faint-gleaming in the dappled east&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till far o'er ether spreads the widening glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, from before the lustre of her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White break the clouds away. With quicken'd step,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brown night retires. Young day pours in apace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opens all the lawny prospect wide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dripping rock, the mountain's misty top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swell on the sight, and brighten with the dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue, through the dusk, the smoking currents shine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the bladed field the fearful hare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Limps, awkward; while along the forest glade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild deer trip, and often turning gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At early passenger. Music awakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The native voice of undissembled joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thick around the woodland hymns arise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rous'd by the cock, the soon-clad shepherd leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mossy cottage, where with peace he dwells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the crowded fold, in order, drives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His flock, to taste the verdure of the morn.</span>

<span class="i0">To meditation due and sacred song?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The zephyrs floating loose, the timely rains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bloom ethereal the light-footed dews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soften'd into joy the surly storms.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The round of nations in a golden chain.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The unfruitful rock itself, impregn'd by thee,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And with a waving radiance inward flames.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thee the sapphire, solid ether, takes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its hue cerulean; and, of evening tinct,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The purple streaming amethyst is thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thy own smile the yellow topaz burns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor deeper verdure dyes the robe of Spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first she gives it to the southern gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the green emerald shows. But, all combin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick through the whitening opal play thy beams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, flying several from its surface, form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trembling variance of revolving hues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the site varies in the gazer's hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The very dead creation, from thy touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assumes a mimic life. By thee refin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In brighter mazes the relucent stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plays o'er the mead. The precipice abrupt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Projecting horror on the blacken'd flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softens at thy return. The desert joys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wildly, through all his melancholy bounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rude ruins glitter; and the briny deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen from some pointed promontory's top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far to the blue horizon's utmost verge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restless, reflects a floating gleam. But this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the much-transported muse can sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are to thy beauty, dignity, and use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unequal far; great delegated source<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I check my steps, and view the broken scene.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Smooth to the shelving brink a copious flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls fair and placid; where collected all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one impetuous torrent, down the steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It thundering shoots, and shakes the country round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first, an azure sheet, it rushes broad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then whitening by degrees as prone it falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the loud-resounding rocks below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dash'd in a cloud of foam, it sends aloft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hoary mist, and forms a ceaseless shower<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, raging still amid the shaggy rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now flashes o'er the scattered fragments, now<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And falling fast from gradual slope to slope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wild infracted course, and lessen'd roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It gains a safer bed, and steals at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the mazes of the quiet vale.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Invited from the cliff, to whose dark brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He clings, the steep-ascending eagle soars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With upward pinions, through the flood of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, giving full his bosom to the blaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gains on the sun; while all the tuneful race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smit by afflictive noon, disorder'd droop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the thicket; or, from bower to bower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Responsive, force an interrupted strain.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Beside the dewy border let me sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in the freshness of the humid air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There on that hollow'd rock, grotesque and wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ample chair moss-lin'd, and overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By flowing umbrage shaded; where the bee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strays diligent, and with the extracted balm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fragrant woodbine loads his little thigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now, while I taste the sweetness of the shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While nature lies around deep-lull'd in noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now come, bold fancy, spread a daring flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And view the wonders of the torrid zone<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From disembowel'd earth the virgin gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the varied landscape, restless, rove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fervent with life of every fairer kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A land of wonders! which the sun still eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ray direct, as of the lovely realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enamor'd, and delighting there to dwell.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How chang'd the scene! In blazing height of noon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun, oppress'd, is plung'd in thickest gloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still horror reigns, a dreary twilight round,</span>

<span class="i0">They furious spring. A boding silence reigns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dread through the dun expanse; save the dull sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from the mountain, previous to the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls o'er the muttering earth, disturbs the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shakes the forest leaf without a breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prone, to the lowest vale, the aerial tribes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descend: the tempest-loving raven scarce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dares wing the dubious dusk. In rueful gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cattle stand, and on the scowling heavens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast a deploring eye; by man forsook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who to the crowded cottage hies him fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or seeks the shelter of the downward cave.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Tis listening fear, and dumb amazement all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When to the startled eye the sudden glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appears far south, eruptive through the cloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And following slower, in explosion vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thunder raises his tremendous voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first, heard solemn o'er the verge of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tempest growls; but as it nearer comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rolls its awful burden on the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lightnings flash a larger curve, and more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noise astounds&mdash;till overhead a sheet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of livid flame discloses wide, then shuts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opens wider, shuts and opens still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expansive, wrapping ether in a blaze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follows the loosen'd aggravated roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enlarging, deepening, mingling, peal on peal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crush'd horrible, convulsing heaven and earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Down comes a deluge of sonorous hail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or prone-descending rain. Wide-rent, the clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour a whole flood; and yet, its flame unquench'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unconquerable lightning struggles through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ragged and fierce, or in red whirling balls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fires the mountains with redoubled rage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black from the stroke, above, the smouldering pine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands a sad shatter'd trunk; and, stretch'd below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lifeless group the blasted cattle lie:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the soft flocks, with that same harmless look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wore alive, and ruminating still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fancy's eye; and there the frowning bull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ox half-rais'd. Struck on the castled cliff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The venerable tower and spiry fane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resign their aged pride. The gloomy woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Start at the flash, and from their deep recess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-flaming out, their trembling inmates shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid Caernarvon's mountains rages loud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The repercussive roar; with mighty crush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the flashing deep, from the rude rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Penmaenmawr heap'd hideous to the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tumble the smitten cliffs; and Snowdon's peak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dissolving, instant yields his wintry load.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far-seen, the heights of heathy Cheviot blaze,</span>

<span class="i1">So pass'd their life, a clear united stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By care unruffled; till, in evil hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tempest caught them on the tender walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heedless how far, and where its mazes stray'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, with each other bless'd, creative love<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the big gloom, on Celadon her eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell tearful, wetting her disorder'd cheek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain assuring love, and confidence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Heaven, repress'd her fear; it grew, and shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her frame near dissolution. He perceiv'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unequal conflict; and, as angels look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On dying saints, his eyes compassion shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With love illumin'd high. "Fear not," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sweet innocence! thou stranger to offense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And inward storm! He who yon skies involves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In frowns and darkness, ever smiles on thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With kind regard. O'er thee the secret shaft<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But who can paint the lover, as he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierc'd by severe amazement, hating life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speechless, and fix'd in all the death of woe!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The well-dissembled mourner stooping stands,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">As from the face of heaven the shatter'd clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tumultuous rove, the interminable sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sublimer swells, and o'er the world expands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A purer azure. Nature, from the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shines out afresh; and through the lighten'd air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A higher lustre and a clearer calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diffusive, tremble; while, as if in sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of danger past, a glittering robe of joy,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Extinguish'd feel that spark the tempest wak'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sense of powers exceeding far his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet his feeble heart has lost its fears?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cheer'd by the milder beam, the sprightly youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speeds to the well-known pool, whose crystal depth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sandy bottom shows. Awhile he stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing the inverted landscape, half-afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meditate the blue profound below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then plunges headlong down the circling flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ebon tresses and his rosy cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant emerge; and through the obedient wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At each short breathing by his lip repell'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arms and legs according well, he makes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As humor leads, an easy-winding path;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, from his polish'd sides, a dewy light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Effuses on the pleas'd spectators round.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This is the purest exercise of health,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kind refresher of the summer heats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, when cold Winter keens the brightening flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I weak-shivering linger on the brink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus life redoubles; and is oft preserved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the bold swimmer, in the swift illapse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of accident disastrous. Hence the limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knit into force; and the same Roman arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rose victorious o'er the conquer'd earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First learned, while tender, to subdue the wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even, from the body's purity, the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receives a secret sympathetic aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Close in the covert of an hazel copse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where winded into pleasing solitudes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs out the rambling dale, young Damon sat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pensive, and pierc'd with love's delightful pangs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There to the stream that down the distant rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoarse-murmuring fell, and plaintive breeze that play'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the bending willows, falsely he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Musidora's cruelty complain'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She felt his flame; but deep within her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In bashful coyness, or in maiden pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soft return conceal'd&mdash;save when it stole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sidelong glances from her downcast eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from her swelling soul in stifled sighs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touched by the scene, no stranger to his vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fram'd a melting lay, to try her heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if an infant passion struggled there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To call that passion forth. Thrice-happy swain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lucky chance, that oft decides the fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mighty monarchs, then decided thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, lo! conducted by the laughing Loves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This cool retreat his Musidora sought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm in her cheek the sultry season glow'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, rob'd in loose array, she came to bathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shall he do? In sweet confusion lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dubious flutterings, he awhile remain'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pure ingenuous elegance of soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A delicate refinement known to few,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perplex'd his breast, and urg'd him to retire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But love forbade. Ye prudes in virtue, say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, ye severest, what would you have done?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, this fairer nymph than ever bless'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arcadian stream, with timid eye around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The banks surveying, stripp'd her beauteous limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To taste the lucid coolness of the flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! then, not Paris on the piny top<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ida panted stronger, when aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rival goddesses the vail divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast unconfin'd, and gave him all their charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than, Damon, thou; as from the snowy leg,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slender foot, the inverted silk she drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the soft touch dissolv'd the virgin zone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, through the parting robe, the alternate breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With youth wild-throbbing, on thy lawless gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In full luxuriance rose. But, desperate youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How durst thou risk the soul-distracting view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from her naked limbs, of glowing white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harmonious swell'd by Nature's finest hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In folds loose-floating fell the fainter lawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair expos'd she stood&mdash;shrunk from herself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fancy blushing, at the doubtful breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alarm'd, and starting like the fearful fawn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the flood she rush'd: the parted flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its lovely guest with closing waves received,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every beauty softening, every grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flushing anew, a mellow lustre shed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As shines the lily through the crystal mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as the rose amid the morning dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh from Aurora's hand, more sweetly glows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thus she wanton'd now beneath the wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ill-concealed, and now with streaming locks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That half-embrac'd her in a humid vail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising again, the latent Damon drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such maddening draughts of beauty to the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for a while o'erwhelm'd his raptur'd thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With luxury too daring. Check'd, at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By love's respectful modesty, he deem'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The theft profane, if aught profane to love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can e'er be deem'd, and, struggling from the shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With headlong hurry fled; but first these lines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trac'd by his ready pencil, on the bank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trembling hand he threw: "Bathe on, my fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet unbeheld save by the sacred eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of faithful love: I go to guard thy haunt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep from thy recess each vagrant foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each licentious eye." With wild surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if to marble struck, devoid of sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stupid moment motionless she stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stands the statue that enchants the world:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bending tries to vail the matchless boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mingled beauties of exulting Greece.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recovering, swift she flew to find those robes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which blissful Eden knew not; and, array'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In careless haste, the alarming paper snatch'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when her Damon's well known hand she saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her terrors vanish'd, and a softer train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mix'd emotions, hard to be describ'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sudden bosom seiz'd: shame void of guilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The charming blush of innocence, esteem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And admiration of her lover's flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By modesty exalted. Even a sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of self-approving beauty stole across<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her busy thought. At length, a tender calm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hushed by degrees the tumult of her soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the spreading beech, that o'er the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Incumbent hung, she with the sylvan pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rural lovers this confession carv'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which soon her Damon kiss'd with weeping joy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dear youth! sole judge of what these verses mean,</span>

<span class="i0">Of distant nations; whose remotest shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can soon be shaken by thy naval arm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to be shook thyself, but all assaults<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baffling, like thy hoar cliffs the loud sea-wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O Thou by whose almighty nod the scale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of empire rises, or alternate falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Send forth the saving virtues round the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In bright patrol: white peace, and social love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tender-looking charity, intent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On gentle deeds, and shedding tears through smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undaunted truth, and dignity of mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Courage compos'd, and keen; sound temperance,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In all their pomp attend his setting throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Air, earth, and ocean smile immense. And now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if his weary chariot sought the bowers<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Forever running an enchanted round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passes the day, deceitful, vain, and void;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fleets the vision o'er the formful brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This moment hurrying wild the impassion'd soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next in nothing lost. 'Tis so to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dreamer of this earth, an idle blank:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sight of horror to the cruel wretch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, all day long in sordid pleasure roll'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself an useless load, has squander'd vile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his scoundrel train, what might have cheer'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A drooping family of modest worth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to the generous still-improving mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gives the hopeless heart to sing for joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diffusing kind beneficence around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boastless, as now descends the silent dew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him the long review of order'd life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is inward rapture, only to be felt.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Confess'd from yonder slow-extinguish'd clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ether softening, sober evening takes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wonted station in the middle air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand shadows at her beck. First this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sends on earth; then that of deeper dye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steals soft behind, and then a deeper still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In circle following circle, gathers round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To close the face of things. A fresher gale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begins to wave the wood, and stir the stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeping with shadowy gust the fields of corn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the quail clamors for his running mate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide o'er the thistly lawn, as swells the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A whitening shower of vegetable down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amusive floats. The kind impartial care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nature naught disdains: thoughtful to feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lowest sons, and clothe the coming year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From field to field the feather'd seeds she wings.</span>

<p>The date of the year was&mdash;no matter what;
the day of the month was&mdash;no matter what;
when a great general undertook to perform a
great victory&mdash;a great statesman undertook to
pass a great political measure&mdash;a great diplomatist
undertook a most important mission&mdash;a
great admiral undertook the command of a great
fleet; all which great undertakings were commanded
by the very same great monarch of a very
great nation. At the same time did a great
nobleman give a great entertainment at a great
house, and a great beauty made a great many
great conquests. On the same day, in the same
year, in a very small room, in a very small
house, in a very small street, in a very small
town in Germany, did a very poor mason commence
a very rude carving on a very rough
stone. All the public journals of the day told
a thousand times over the names of the great
general, the great statesman, the great diplomatist,
the great admiral, and the great monarch;
all the fashionable papers of the day did the
same of the great nobleman, the great company,
and the great beauty: but none of them spoke
of poor Johan Schmit, of the little town of &mdash;&mdash;,
on the Rhine.</p>

<p>Many years had passed away, and the date
of the year was&mdash;no matter what; but history
was telling of a great general who, with consummate
wisdom, courage, and skill, and at the
cost of numberless nameless lives, gained a
great victory, which determined the fate and
fortune of a great monarch and a great nation;
consequently affecting the fate and fortunes of
the world. It entered into minute detail of
how his forces were disposed; where lay the
right wing, where lay the left; where the cavalry
advanced, and how the infantry sustained
the attack; how the guns of the artillery played
upon the enemy's flank and rear; and how the
heavy dragoons rode down the routed forces, and
how, finally, the field was covered with the enemy's
dead and wounded, while so few of "our
own troops" were left for the kite and the carrion
crow. Then did history speak of the honors
that awaited and rewarded the triumphant
hero, of the clamorous homage of his grateful
country, and the approving smiles of his grateful
monarch; of the <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, the banquets, the
triumphal processions, all in his honor; of the
new titles, the lands, estates, and riches poured
upon him; of the state and luxury in which he
lived: until the tolling of every bell throughout
the kingdom, the eight-horse hearse, the mile-long
procession, the Dead March in "Saul," and
the volley over the grave, announced that a
public statue, on a column a hundred feet high,
in the largest square of the largest town, was
all that could now record the name of the
greatest general of the greatest nation in the
world.</p>

<p>History then spoke of a great statesman who
on a certain day in a certain year, passed a certain
most important measure, affecting the interest
of a great nation, and consequently of
the whole world. It spoke of his wisdom and
foresight, the result of great intellect, energy
and labor, giving a biographic sketch of his
career from cradle to coffin; dismissing him
with a long eulogium on his talents, integrity,
and activity, and lamenting the loss such great
men were to their country. Then came the
name of the great diplomatist whose services
had been equally important, and who was dismissed
with a similar memoir and eulogium.
Then the great admiral, who lived through a
whole chapter all to himself, and had his name
brought in throughout the whole history of the
great monarch whose reign had been rendered
so brilliant by the great deeds of so many great
men. Of the great feast given by the great
nobleman, and the conquests of the great beauty,
there remains to this day a record, of the former
in the adulatory poems of his flatterers, though
the giver was gone&mdash;no matter where; of the
latter many fair portraits and many fond sonnets,
though the object had gone&mdash;no matter
where. But no scribe told the history, no
poet made a sonnet, no artist drew the portrait
of poor Johan Schmit, the mason, who made the
rude carving on the rough stone in the little
town of &mdash;&mdash;, on the Rhine. This task remains
for an historian as obscure as himself, who now
begins a rude carving on the rough stone of a
human life.</p>

<p>After the example of the great historian already
alluded to, I shall touch but lightly on
the early history of my hero; merely stating
that thirty years before the present date, Johan
Schmit was born to Johan Schmit the elder, by
his wife Gretchen, after a similar presentation
of five others; that he got through the usual
maladies childhood is heir to, and was at the
age of fifteen apprenticed to Herman Schwartz,
a master-builder in the town of Bonn. There,
after some years of hod-carrying, mortar-spreading,
and stone-cutting&mdash;ascending steadily, both
literally and metaphorically, the ladder of his
profession&mdash;honest Johan took a prudent, diligent
woman to wife, who lost no time in making
him the father of three thriving heirs to his
house and his hod. Johan was in tolerably
good work, lived in the small house in the small
street already mentioned, and kept his family,
without much pinching on the part of the thrifty
Gertrude, in their beer, thick bread, and sauerkraut.
His work, his wife, his children, and his
two companions, Karl Vratz, and Caspar Katzheim,
with whom he drank very hoppy beer at
the "Gold Apfel," just round the corner of the
street, comprised the whole interests which
occupied the heart and brain of Johan Schmit,
of the little town of &mdash;&mdash;, on the Rhine. Johan
had no other idea in his head when he rose in
the morning than the day's work, the same as
it was yesterday, and would be to-morrow; no
other thought when he returned from it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
evening than that Frudchen had his supper
ready for him, that little Wilhelm and Johan
would run to meet him, and that little Rosechen,
the baby, would crow out of her cradle at him,
if awake, and that after his supper he would
just walk down to the "Gold Apfel," and
smoke a pipe with Karl and Caspar as usual.
But Johan went to church occasionally with his
wife, going through his routine of crossings,
genuflexions, and sprinklings with holy water as
orderly as any man. He heard the priest speak
of doing his duty and obeying the church.
Johan believed he did both; his duty&mdash;hard
work&mdash;lay plainly before him; he was honest,
sober, and kind to his family, and had certainly
no idea or intention of disobeying the church.
Thus, in a monotonous task of hard labor for
daily bread and the support of an increasing
family, plodded contentedly away the life of
Johan Schmit of the little town of &mdash;&mdash;, on the
Rhine.</p>

<p>But there is an era in the life of every one,
even the most plodding and homely; and so it
was with Johan Schmit. It happened one day
that he was sent for to repair a broken wall in
the ch&acirc;teau of the Count von Rosenheim, situated
not far from the town where Johan lived, on
the Rhine; and having completed his job, the
housekeeper (the count being absent) took the
poor mason through the splendid rooms as a
treat. Here he beheld what he had never seen
in his life before; velvet curtains, silken sofas,
crystal mirrors, gilded frames, paintings, and
sculpture; until his eyes were more dazzled
than they had been since the first time he
entered the cathedral of Bonn. But after gazing
his fill upon all this gorgeous spectacle, his
eyes happened to fall upon a small bronze
statuette of an angel, which the housekeeper
informed him was a copy of the Archangel
Michael, from some church, she knew not
where.</p>

<p>Here was Johan arrested, and here would he
have stood forever; for, after looking upon this
angel, he saw nothing more: every thing vanished
from before him, and nothing remained
but the small bronze statuette. Johan had
seen plenty of angels before in the churches,
fresh-colored, chubby children, and he often
thought his own little Rosechen would look
just like them if she had wings; but this was
something far different. A youth under twenty,
and yet it gave no more idea of either age or
sex than of any other earthly condition. Clad
in what Johan supposed would represent luminous
scale-armor, something dazzling and transparent,
like what he had heard the priests call
the "armor of God"&mdash;the hands crossed upon
the bosom, the head slightly bowed, the attitude
so full of awe, obedience, and humility; and
yet what attitude of human pride or defiance
was half so lofty, so noble, so dignified? The
sword hung sheathed by the side, the long wings
folded; but the face&mdash;oh, how could he describe
that face, so full of high earnestness and holy
calm? so bright, so serious, so serene! He felt
awed, calmed, and elevated as he looked at
it.</p>

<p>"You must go now," exclaimed Madame
Grossenberg; and Johan started from his reverie,
made his bow, replaced his paper cap, and went
home, with his head full of the angel instead of
his work. He saw it there instead of stout
Frudchen and the children, who climbed about,
and wondered at his abstraction. He went to
bed, and dreamed of the angel&mdash;glorified it
seemed to be&mdash;and, perhaps for the first time in
his life, recalled his dream, and saw the beautiful
vision before his waking eyes all the next
day at his work&mdash;even in the "Gold Apfel,"
the most unlikely place for an angel; and again
when he closed his eyes to sleep. In short, the
angel became to him what his gold is to the
miser, his power is to the ambitious man, and
his mistress to the lover: he saw nothing else
in the whole world but the angel; and this now
filled the heart and brain of poor Johan Schmit,
of the little town of &mdash;&mdash;, on the Rhine.</p>

<p>There are some things we desire to possess,
and other things we desire to produce; the
former is the feeling of the connoisseur and
collector: the latter, of the artist. The first
requires taste and money; the latter&mdash;we won't
say what it requires, or what it evinces, for
enough has been said on the subject already.
Johan Schmit had no money; taste he must
have had, or he could not have admired the
angel; he was no artist, certainly; he had
never drawn a line, or cut any thing but a
stone in his life; and yet he felt he must do
something about that angel. He saw it so
plainly and so constantly before him, that he
felt he could copy it, if he only knew how.
Now, as he could not draw, he could not copy
it in that manner; but as he could cut stone,
no matter how hard, he did not see why he
might not attempt to cut the angel upon a
large stone, which he procured, and brought
quietly up to a small garret at the top of his
house for that purpose.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the general, the
statesman, the diplomatist, and the admiral,
all severally planned their great undertakings;
and it was at this time that a strange thought
passed through the brain of Johan Schmit, as
he sate looking at the great rough stone before
him. Johan was, as we have seen, quite an
uneducated man; he hardly knew enough of
writing to spell his own name; and as to reading,
he had never looked into a book since he
left school, at the age of twelve; he therefore
hardly knew the nature of his own ideas. His
thoughts, never arranged, were but like vague
sensations passing through his mind, which he
could not define; but if he could have defined
them they would have taken something like the
following expression:</p>

<p>The angel seemed to have awakened a new
world within him; not that he thought of the
legend of the Archangel Michael, which he had
heard long ago, and forgotten; but of the first
idea of the artist who designed that particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
angel: what must have been his thoughts!
what image must he have had before him as he
made that form grow from the marble block
into living beauty! Whence could such an
idea have come? It must surely have been a
visitation from God&mdash;a spark of his own creative
power. And how must the artist have felt as,
day by day and hour by hour, he saw his work
developing and perfecting before him, until at
last it stood up, a sight to make men wonder
and almost worship&mdash;an embodiment of all that
was pure, lofty, and holy. Then came the contrast
of his own sordid work, so low, so slave-like,
so brute-like. What human idea could be
put into hod-carrying, mortar-spreading, and
stone-cutting? Could not an animal or a
machine do as much? For the first time, perhaps,
in his life, Johan felt that he had a soul
not to be bounded by the limits of his work or
the daily necessities of existence; and in his
rough way he asked himself: How can the
higher aspirations of that soul be reflected in
man's every-day life? and whether a human
mind should be bounded by the narrow routine
of plodding toil, for the supplying of common
wants? And all these thoughts, vague, unformed,
a dim and undefined sense of something,
passed through Johan's brain as he sate cutting
away at the stone, and trying to form the angel
in his little garret, in the little town of &mdash;&mdash;,
on the Rhine. Patiently he labored at it after
his day's work was over; patiently he bore all
his failures, when he saw in the indistinct outline
that the angel's arm was too short, its right
leg crooked, its wings shapeless, and its head,
instead of bending gracefully, stuck upon its
breast like an excrescence; patiently he bore
the scoldings of his wife for his dullness and
abstraction, and the tricks of his children to
arouse him; patiently he listened to the remonstrances
of Karl and Caspar, for his bad companionship
at the "Gold Apfel;" and patiently
he bore the still more serious remonstrances of
his master, at the careless and negligent manner
in which he often performed his work, when a
vision of the angel chanced to flit with more
than usual vividness before him. Time wore
on; and if Johan did not progress rapidly with
his angel, Gertrude was far more active and
diligent in presenting him with images in
another material, and urging loudly at the same
time the necessity of working hard for an increasing
family. Poor Gertrude: she was a
good woman, and loved her husband without
understanding him; but she had a quick temper,
and was what is commonly called a shrew.
She thought Johan wanted rousing; and to
rouse him she rated him: he bore it all patiently,
and thought of the angel&mdash;it was
strange how that angel soothed and consoled
him! Caspar, his fellow-workman, fell from a
scaffold, and broke his leg. Caspar, too, had a
wife and children: Johan undertook his work&mdash;he
worked double hours, and divided his wages
with Caspar.</p>

<p>Karl revealed to him in confidence over his
pipe at the "Gold Apfel," that he was in debt,
and had been threatened with a jail: Johan
lent him the money unknown to Gertrude, and
worked hard to make it up; as he knew Karl
could never pay him.</p>

<p>He had now no time to work at the angel;
and time was going on with him. By his little
broken looking-glass he could see his beard
growing gray; but strange to say, the angel,
though less distinct in form than when he saw
it, was still firmly fixed in his memory; and
though it seemed to be etherialized, he could
always call up its image before him; and still,
every moment he could spare, did he hasten to
his garret, and cut away at the rough stone.
But these hours were stolen from his natural
rest, and nature punished the theft; his strength
visibly declined. Yet he could not abandon his
work&mdash;and this not from any ambitious ideas
of its success, for he never dreamed of succeeding&mdash;he
felt his own inability too much to hope
for it;&mdash;but there was something in the exercise
of will, mind, and heart&mdash;something which
seemed to elevate him in spite of himself, while
at his employment, that balanced all other feelings
of disappointment and weariness, making
him a happier&mdash;no, that is not the word, but a
nobler&mdash;man. And now Johan Schmit had
contrived to apprentice his eldest son, send his
second to school, pay the doctor's long bill for
two children, and bury another; besides having
helped Caspar during his illness, and paid
Karl's debt. Thrifty Gertrude managed to
keep things together; and in her cleaning and
bustling had no time to observe the wan face
and wasted frame of her husband. The stone
had been gradually cut into a form which was
nearly as shapeless as before Johan touched it;
and yet, to his eyes, it did bear some rude resemblance
to the angel of his inspiration&mdash;which
appeared before his eyes so vividly as he
returned from an unusually-long and hard day's
work to his home, that he thought he could just
put one or two finishing strokes before going to
bed which would recall his dimly-remembered
model. Without touching supper or pipe, he
embraced his wife and children, and went to his
garret. He looked long on the rude block before
him, and then took up his hammer and
chisel to complete his work. After two or three
attempts, an unwonted languor stole over him;
the tools dropped from his hands, and he worked
no more; but the vision of the angel before his
eyes grew stronger and stronger, and of something
brighter and more glorious than the angel,
but he did not attempt to carve it.</p>

<p>In the early morning Gertrude awoke, and
was surprised not to see her husband. Thinking
he might have risen to his work earlier than
usual, she arose and went down stairs; the
door was bolted, and there were no signs of
Johan. She called; no answer: then, becoming
alarmed, she roused the children to look for
him. The small house was soon searched, but
no Johan discovered; when Wilhelm, remembering
the garret he had seen his father steal away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
into, ascended the ladder leading to it&mdash;and
there, on his knees, his head resting on the rude
block of stone, lay the lifeless body of Johan
Schmit. The last thing his eyes beheld on
earth was <i>that</i> angel;&mdash;but who can say on
what vision they opened.</p>

<p>His wife and children removed to Bonn, to
her father; who had saved money, and promised
to take care of them. His body was laid in
the little cemetery of the little town: his widow
placed a wooden cross at the head of his grave,
which in time, rotted and fell down; so that the
place is now left unmarked by any thing. That
stone, on which a human heart had carved
itself out, was broken up to mend the town
wall. And thus, while a large marble slab,
with a long inscription, covers the remains of
the great general, the great statesman, the
great diplomatist, the great admiral, the great
nobleman, and the great beauty&mdash;not even a
piece of wood or a block of stone tells of the
mere existence of poor Johan Schmit, of the
little town of &mdash;&mdash;, on the Rhine.</p>

<p>They could work out their idea of life, and
the objects for which it was given, by their successful
dedication of it to pride, ambition, vanity,
and coquetry. <i>He</i> could not; but who can
tell what effect that futile effort, that unknown
and profitless toil, may have had upon the fate
of his soul where it now is?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<h4>"THE BREAKFAST AT LETTERKENNY."</h4>

<p>Early the next morning, a messenger arrived
from the Cranagh, with a small packet
of my clothes and effects, and a farewell letter
from the two brothers. I had but time to
glance over its contents, when the tramp of
feet and the buzz of voices in the street attracted
me to the window, and on looking out
I saw a long line of men, two abreast, who
were marching along as prisoners, a party of
dismounted dragoons, keeping guard over them
on either side, followed by a strong detachment
of marines. The poor fellows looked sad and
crest-fallen enough. Many of them wore bandages
on their heads and limbs, the tokens of
the late struggle. Immediately in front of the
inn door stood a group of about thirty persons;
they were the staff of the English force and the
officers of our fleet, all mingled together, and
talking away with the greatest air of unconcern.
I was struck by remarking that all our
seamen, though prisoners, saluted the officers
as they passed, and in the glances interchanged
I thought I could read a world of sympathy and
encouragement. As for the officers, like true
Frenchmen, they bore themselves as though it
were one of the inevitable chances of war, and,
however vexatious for the moment, not to be
thought of as an event of much importance.
The greater number of them belonged to the
army, and I could see the uniforms of the staff,
artillery, and dragoons, as well as the less distinguished
costume of the line.</p>

<p>Perhaps they carried the affectation of indifference
a little too far, and in the lounging ease
of their attitude, and the cool unconcern with
which they puffed their cigars, displayed an
over-anxiety to seem unconcerned. That the
English were piqued at their bearing was still
more plain to see; and indeed in the sullen
looks of the one and the careless gayety of the
other party, a stranger might readily have mistaken
the captor for the captive.</p>

<p>My two friends of the evening before were in
the midst of the group. He who had questioned
me so sharply now wore a general officer's
uniform, and seemed to be the chief in command.
As I watched him, I heard him addressed
by an officer, and now saw that he was
no other than Lord Cavan himself, while the
other was a well-known magistrate and country
gentleman, Sir George Hill.</p>

<p>The sad procession took almost half an hour
to defile; and then came a long string of country
cars and carts, with sea chests and other
stores belonging to our officers, and, last of all,
some eight or ten ammunition wagons and gun
carriages, over which an English union-jack
now floated in token of conquest.</p>

<p>There was nothing like exultation or triumph
exhibited by the peasantry as this pageant
passed by. They gazed in silent wonderment
at the scene, looked like men that scarcely knew
whether the result boded more of good or evil
to their own fortunes. While keenly scrutinizing
the looks and bearing of the bystanders I
received a summons to meet the general and
his party at breakfast.</p>

<p>Although the occurrence was one of the most
pleasurable incidents of my life, which brought
me once more into intercourse with my comrades
and my countrymen, I should perhaps
pass it over with slight mention, were it not
that it made me witness to a scene which has
since been recorded in various different ways,
but of whose exact details I profess to be an
accurate narrator.</p>

<p>After making a tour of the room, saluting
my comrades, answering questions here, putting
others there, I took my place at the long table,
which, running the whole length of the apartment,
was indiscriminately occupied by French
and English, and found myself with my back
to the fire-place, and having directly in front of
me a man of about thirty-three or four years of
age, dressed in the uniform of a chef de brigade;
light-haired and blue-eyed, he bore no resemblance
whatever to those around him, whose
dark faces and black beards, proclaimed them of
a foreign origin. There was an air of mildness
in his manner, mingled with a certain impetuosity
that betrayed itself in the rapid glances of
his eye, and I could plainly mark that while the
rest were perfectly at their ease, he was constrained,
restless, watching eagerly every thing
that went forward about him, and showing
unmistakably a certain anxiety and distrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
widely differing from the gay and careless indifference
of his comrades. I was curious to
hear his name, and on asking, learned that he
was the Chef de Brigade Smith, an Irishman
by birth, but holding a command in the French
service.</p>

<p>I had but asked the question, when pushing
back his chair from the table, he arose suddenly,
and stood stiff and erect, like a soldier
on the parade.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I hope you are satisfied with your
inspection of me," cried he, and sternly addressing
himself to some one behind my back. I
turned and perceived it was Sir George Hill,
who stood in front of the fire, leaning on his
stick. Whether he replied or not to this rude
speech I am unable to say, but the other walked
leisurely round the table, and came directly in
front of him. "You know me <i>now</i>, sir, I presume,"
said he, in the same imperious voice,
"or else this uniform has made a greater
change in my appearance than I knew of."</p>

<p>"Mr. Tone!" said Sir George, in a voice
scarcely above a whisper.</p>

<p>"Ay, sir, Wolfe Tone; there is no need of
secrecy here; Wolfe Tone, your old college acquaintance
in former times, but now chef de
brigade in the service of France."</p>

<p>"This is a very unexpected, a very unhappy
meeting, Mr. Tone," said Hill, feelingly; "I
sincerely wish you had not recalled the memory
of our past acquaintance. <i>My</i> duty gives me
no alternative."</p>

<p>"Your duty, or I mistake much, can have no
concern with me, sir," cried Tone, in a more
excited voice.</p>

<p>"I ask for nothing better than to be sure of
this, Mr. Tone," said Sir George, moving slowly
toward the door.</p>

<p>"You would treat me like an emigr&eacute; rentr&eacute;,"
cried Tone, passionately; "but I am a French
subject and a French officer."</p>

<p>"I shall be well satisfied if others take the
same view of your case, I assure you," said Hill,
as he gained the door.</p>

<p>"You'll not find me unprepared for either
event, sir," rejoined Tone, following him out of
the room, and banging the door angrily behind
him.</p>

<p>For a moment or two the noise of voices was
heard from without, and several of the guests,
English and French, rose from the table, eagerly
inquiring what had occurred, and asking for an
explanation of the scene, when suddenly the
door was flung wide open, and Tone appeared
between two policemen, his coat off, and his
wrists inclosed in handcuffs.</p>

<p>"Look here, comrades," he cried in French;
"this is another specimen of English politeness
and hospitality. After all," added he, with a
bitter laugh, "they have no designation in all
their heraldry as honorable as these fetters,
when worn for the cause of freedom! Good-by,
comrades; we may never meet again, but
don't forget how we parted!"</p>

<p>These were the last words he uttered, when
the door was closed, and he was led forward
under charge of a strong force of police and
military. A post-chaise was soon seen to pass
the windows at speed, escorted by dragoons, and
we saw no more of our comrade.</p>

<p>The incident passed even more rapidly than
I write it. The few words spoken, the hurried
gestures, the passionate exclamations, are yet
all deeply graven on my memory; and I can
recall every little incident of the scene, and
every feature of the locality wherein it occurred.
With true French levity many reseated themselves
at the breakfast-table; while others, with
perhaps as little feeling, but more of curiosity,
discussed the event, and sought for an explanation
of its meaning.</p>

<p>"Then what's to become of Tiernay," cried
one, "if it be so hard to throw off this 'coil of
Englishman?' <i>His</i> position may be just as
precarious."</p>

<p>"That is exactly what has occurred," said
Lord Cavan; "a warrant for his apprehension
has just been put into my hands, and I deeply
regret that the duty should violate that of hospitality,
and make my guest my prisoner."</p>

<p>"May I see this warrant, my lord?" asked I.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. Here it is; and here is the
information on oath through which it was
issued, sworn to before three justices of the
peace by a certain Joseph Dowall, late an
officer in the rebel forces, but now a pardoned
approver of the Crown; do you remember such
a man, sir?"</p>

<p>I bowed, and he went on.</p>

<p>"He would seem a precious rascal; but such
characters become indispensable in times like
these. After all, M. Tiernay, my orders are
only to transmit you to Dublin under safe escort,
and there is nothing either in <i>my</i> duty or in <i>your</i>
position to occasion any feeling, of unpleasantness
between <i>us</i>. Let us have a glass of wine
together."</p>

<p>I responded to this civil proposition with
politeness, and after a slight interchange of
leave-takings with some of my newly-found
comrades, I set out for Derry on a jaunting-car,
accompanied by an officer and two policemen,
affecting to think very little of a circumstance
which, in reality, the more I reflected over the
more serious I deemed it.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<h4>A SCENE IN THE ROYAL BARRACKS.</h4>

<p>It would afford me little pleasure to write,
and doubtless my readers less to read my lucubrations,
as I journeyed along toward Dublin.
My thoughts seldom turned from myself and
my own fortunes, nor were they cheered by the
scenes through which I traveled. The season
was a backward and wet one, and the fields,
partly from this cause, and partly from the
people being engaged in the late struggle, lay
untilled and neglected. Groups of idle, lounging
peasants stood in the villages, or loitered on
the high roads, as we passed, sad, ragged-looking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and wretched. They seemed as if they had
no heart to resume their wonted life of labor,
but were waiting for some calamity to close their
miserable existence. Strongly in contrast with
this were the air and bearing of the yeomanry
and militia detachments, with whom we occasionally
came up. Quite forgetting how little
creditable to some of them, at least, were the
events of the late campaign, they gave themselves
the most intolerable airs of heroism, and
in their drunken jollity, and reckless abandonment,
threatened, I know not what&mdash;utter ruin
to France and all Frenchmen. Bonaparte was
the great mark of all their sarcasms, and, from
some cause or other, seemed to enjoy a most disproportioned
share of their dislike and derision.</p>

<p>At first it required some effort of constraint
on my part to listen to this ribaldry in silence;
but prudence, and a little sense, taught me the
safer lesson of "never minding," and so I
affected to understand nothing that was said
in a spirit of insult or offense.</p>

<p>On the night of the 7th of November we
drew nigh to Dublin; but instead of entering
the capital, we halted at a small village outside
of it called Chapelizod. Here a house
had been fitted up for the reception of French
prisoners, and I found myself, if not in company,
at least under the same roof with my
countrymen.</p>

<p>Nearer intercourse than this, however, I was
not destined to enjoy, for early on the following
morning I was ordered to set out for the Royal
Barracks, to be tried before a court-martial. It
was on a cold, raw morning, with a thin, drizzly
rain falling, that we drove into the barrack-yard,
and drew up at the mess-room, then used
for the purposes of a court. As yet none of
the members had assembled, and two or three
mess-waiters were engaged in removing the
signs of last night's debauch, and restoring a
semblance of decorum to a very rackety-looking
apartment. The walls were scrawled over
with absurd caricatures, in charcoal or ink,
of notorious characters of the capital, and a
very striking "battle-piece" commemorated the
"Races of Castlebar," as that memorable action
was called, in a spirit, I am bound to say,
of little flattery to the British arms. There
were to be sure little compensatory illustrations
here and there of French cavalry in Egypt,
mounted on donkeys, or revolutionary troops on
parade, ragged as scarecrows, and ill-looking as
highwaymen; but a most liberal justice characterized
all these frescoes, and they treated
both Trojan and Tyrian alike.</p>

<p>I had abundant time given me to admire
them, for although summoned for seven o'clock,
it was nine before the first officer of the court-martial
made his appearance, and he having
popped in his head, and perceiving the room
empty; sauntered out again, and disappeared.
At last a very noisy jaunting-car rattled into
the square, and a short, red-faced man was assisted
down from it, and entered the mess-room.
This was Mr. Peters, the Deputy Judge Advocate,
whose presence was the immediate signal
for the others, who now came dropping in from
every side, the President, a Colonel Daly, arriving
the last.</p>

<p>A few tradespeople, loungers, it seemed to me,
of the barrack, and some half-dozen non-commissioned
officers off duty, made up the public;
and I could not but feel a sense of my insignificance
in the utter absence of interest my fate
excited. The listless indolence and informality,
too, offended and insulted me; and when the
President politely told me to be seated, for they
were obliged to wait for some books or papers
left behind at his quarters, I actually was indignant
at his coolness.</p>

<p>As we thus waited, the officers gathered
around the fire-place, chatting and laughing
pleasantly together, discussing the social events
of the capital, and the gossip of the day; every
thing, in fact, but the case of the individual on
whose future fate they were about to decide.</p>

<p>At length the long-expected books made their
appearance, and a few well-thumbed volumes
were spread over the table, behind which the
Court took their places, Colonel Daly in the centre,
with the Judge upon his left.</p>

<p>The members being sworn, the Judge Advocate
arose, and in a hurried, humdrum kind of
voice, read out what purported to be the commission
under which I was to be tried; the
charge being, whether I had or had not acted
treacherously and hostilely to his Majesty, whose
natural born subject I was, being born in that
kingdom, and, consequently, owing to him all
allegiance and fidelity. "Guilty or not guilty,
sir?"</p>

<p>"The charge is a falsehood; I am a Frenchman,"
was my answer.</p>

<p>"Have respect for the Court, sir," said
Peters; "you mean that you are a French
officer, but by birth an Irishman."</p>

<p>"I mean no such thing;&mdash;that I am French
by birth, as I am in feeling&mdash;that I never saw
Ireland till within a few months back, and
heartily wish I had never seen it."</p>

<p>"So would General Humbert, too, perhaps,"
said Daly, laughing; and the Court seemed to
relish the jest.</p>

<p>"Where were you born, then, Tiernay?"</p>

<p>"In Paris, I believe."</p>

<p>"And your mother's name, what was it?"</p>

<p>"I never knew; I was left an orphan when
a mere infant, and can tell little of my family."</p>

<p>"Your father was Irish, then?"</p>

<p>"Only by descent. I have heard that we
came from a family who bore the title of 'Timmahoo'&mdash;Lord
Tiernay of Timmahoo."</p>

<p>"There was such a title," interposed Peters;
"it was one of King James's last creations after
his flight from the Boyne. Some, indeed, assert
that it was conferred before the battle. What
a strange coincidence, to find the descendant, if
he be such, laboring in something like the same
cause as his ancestor."</p>

<p>"What's your rank, sir?" asked a sharp,
severe-looking man, called Major Flood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"First Lieutenant of Hussars."</p>

<p>"And is it usual for a boy of your years to
hold that rank; or was there any thing peculiar
in your case that obtained the promotion?"</p>

<p>"I served in two campaigns, and gained my
grade regularly."</p>

<p>"Your Irish blood, then, had no share in your
advancement?" asked he again.</p>

<p>"I am a Frenchman, as I said before," was
my answer.</p>

<p>"A Frenchman, who lays claim to an Irish
estate and an Irish title," replied Flood. "Let
us hear Dowall's statement."</p>

<p>And now, to my utter confusion, a man made
his way to the table, and, taking the book from
the Judge Advocate, kissed it in token of an
oath.</p>

<p>"Inform the Court of any thing you know in
connection with the prisoner," said the Judge.</p>

<p>And the fellow, not daring even to look
toward me, began a long, rambling, unconnected
narrative of his first meeting with me at Killala,
affecting that a close intimacy had subsisted
between us, and that in the faith of a confidence,
I had told him how, being an Irishman by birth,
I had joined the expedition in the hope that
with the expulsion of the English I should be
able to re-establish my claim to my family rank
and fortune. There was little coherence in his
story, and more than one discrepant statement
occurred in it; but the fellow's natural stupidity
imparted a wonderful air of truth to the narrative,
and I was surprised how naturally it sounded
even to my own ears, little circumstances of
truth being interspersed through the recital, as
though to season the falsehood into a semblance
of fact.</p>

<p>"What have you to reply to this, Tiernay?"
asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Simply, sir, that such a witness, were his
assertions even more consistent and probable, is
utterly unworthy of credit. This fellow was
one of the greatest marauders of the rebel army:
and the last exercise of authority I ever witnessed
by General Humbert was an order to drive him
out of the town of Castlebar."</p>

<p>"Is this the notorious Town-Major Dowall?"
asked an officer of artillery.</p>

<p>"The same, sir."</p>

<p>"I can answer, then, for his being one of the
greatest rascals unhanged," rejoined he.</p>

<p>"This is all very irregular, gentlemen," interposed
the Judge Advocate; "the character of a
witness can not be impugned by what is mere
desultory conversation. Let Dowall withdraw."</p>

<p>The man retired, and now a whispered conversation
was kept up at the table for about a
quarter of an hour, in which I could distinctly
separate those who befriended from those who
opposed me, the Major being the chief of the
latter party. One speech of his which I overheard
made a slight impression on me, and for
the first time suggested uneasiness regarding
the event.</p>

<p>"Whatever you do with this lad must have
an immense influence on Tone's trial. Don't
forget that if you acquit him you'll be sorely
puzzled to convict the other."</p>

<p>The Colonel promptly overruled this unjust
suggestion, and maintained that in my accent,
manner, and appearance, there was every evidence
of my French origin.</p>

<p>"Let Wolfe Tone stand upon his own merits,"
said he, "but let us not mix this case with his."</p>

<p>"I'd have treated every man who landed to
a rope," exclaimed the Major, "Humbert himself
among the rest. It was pure 'brigandage,'
and nothing less."</p>

<p>"I hope if I escape, sir, that it will never be
my fortune to see you a prisoner of France,"
said I, forgetting all in my indignation.</p>

<p>"If my voice have any influence, young man,
that opportunity is not likely to occur to you,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>This ungenerous speech found no sympathy
with the rest, and I soon saw that the Major
represented a small minority in the Court.</p>

<p>The want of my commission, or of any document
suitable to my rank or position in the service,
was a great drawback; for I had given all
my papers to Humbert, and had nothing to substantiate
my account of myself. I saw how unfavorably
this acknowledgement was taken by
the Court; and when I was ordered to withdraw
that they might deliberate, I own that I felt
great misgivings as to the result.</p>

<p>The deliberation was a long, and as I could
overhear, a strongly disputed one. Dowall was
twice called in for examination, and when he
retired on the last occasion, the discussion grew
almost stormy.</p>

<p>As I stood thus awaiting my fate, the public,
now removed from the Court, pressed eagerly to
look at me; and while some thronged the door-way,
and even pressed against the sentry, others
crowded at the window to peep in. Among
these faces, over which my eye ranged in half
vacancy, one face struck me, for the expression
of sincere sympathy and interest it bore. It
was that of a middle-aged man of an humble
walk in life, whose dress bespoke him from the
country. There was nothing in his appearance
to have called for attention or notice, and at
any other time I should have passed him over
without remark, but now, as his features betokened
a feeling almost verging on anxiety, I
could not regard him without interest.</p>

<p>Whichever way my eyes turned, however my
thoughts might take me off, whenever I looked
toward him, I was sure to find his gaze steadily
bent upon me, and with an expression quite distinct
from mere curiosity. At last came the
summons for me to reappear before the Court,
and the crowd opened to let me pass in.</p>

<p>The noise, the anxiety of the moment, and
the movement of the people confused me at first,
and when I recovered self-possession, I found
that the Judge Advocate was reciting the charge
under which I was tried. There were three distinct
counts, on each of which the Court pronounced
me "<span class="smcap">Not Guilty</span>," but at the same
time qualifying the finding by the additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
words&mdash;"by a majority of two;" thus showing
me that my escape had been a narrow one.</p>

<p>"As a prisoner of war," said the President,
"you will now receive the same treatment as
your comrades of the same rank. Some have
been already exchanged, and some have given
bail for their appearance to answer any future
charges against them."</p>

<p>"I am quite ready, sir, to accept my freedom
on parole," said I; "of course, in a country
where I am an utter stranger, bail is out of the
question."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to bail him, your worship; I'll
take it on me to be surety for him," cried a
coarse, husky voice from the body of the court;
and at the same time a man dressed in a great
coat of dark frieze pressed through the crowd
and approached the table.</p>

<p>"And who are you, my good fellow, so ready
to impose yourself on the Court?" asked Peters.</p>

<p>"I'm a farmer of eighty acres of land, from
the Black Pits, near Baldoyle, and the Adjutant
there, Mr. Moore, knows me well."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Adjutant, "I have known
you some years, as supplying forage to the
cavalry, and always heard you spoken of as
honest and trust-worthy."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Moore; that's as much as
I want."</p>

<p>"Yes; but it's not as much as <i>we</i> want, my
worthy man," said Peters; "we require to know
that you are a solvent and respectable person."</p>

<p>"Come out and see my place then; ride over
the land and look at my stock; ask my neighbors
my character; find out if there's any thing
against me."</p>

<p>"We prefer to leave all that trouble on <i>your</i>
shoulders," said Peters; "show us that we
may accept your surety and we'll entertain the
question at once."</p>

<p>"How much is it?" asked he, eagerly.</p>

<p>"We demanded five hundred pounds for a
Major on the staff; suppose we say two, Colonel,
is that sufficient?" asked Peters of the President.</p>

<p>"I should say quite enough," was the reply.</p>

<p>"There's eighty of it any way," said the
farmer, producing a dirty roll of bank notes,
and throwing them on the table; "I got them
from Mr. Murphy in Smithfield this morning,
and I'll get twice as much more from him for
asking; so if your honors will wait 'till I come
back, I'll not be twenty minutes away."</p>

<p>"But we can't take your money, my man;
we have no right to touch it."</p>

<p>"Then what are ye talking about two hundred
pounds for?" asked he, sternly.</p>

<p>"We want your promise to pay in the event
of this bail being broken."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see, it's all the same thing in the end;
I'll do it either way."</p>

<p>"We'll accept Mr. Murphy's guarantee for
your solvency," said Peters; "obtain that and
you can sign the bond at once."</p>

<p>"Faith I'll get it sure enough, and be here
before you've the writing drawn out;" said he,
buttoning up his coat.</p>

<p>"What name are we to insert in the bond?"</p>

<p>"Tiernay, sir."</p>

<p>"That's the prisoner's name, but we want
yours."</p>

<p>"Mine's Tiernay too, sir, Pat Tiernay of the
Black Pits."</p>

<p>Before I could recover from my surprise at
this announcement he had left the Court, which,
in a few minutes afterward, broke up, a clerk
alone remaining to fill up the necessary documents
and complete the bail-bond.</p>

<p>The Colonel, as well as two others of his
officers, pressed me to join them at breakfast,
but I declined, resolving to wait for my name-sake's
return, and partake of no other hospitality
than his.</p>

<p>It was near one o'clock when he returned,
almost worn out with fatigue, since he had
been in pursuit of Mr. Murphy for several hours,
and only came upon him by chance at last.
His business, however, he had fully accomplished;
the bail-bond was duly drawn out and
signed, and I left the barrack in a state of happiness
very different from the feeling with which
I had entered it that day.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.</h3>

<h4>A BRIEF CHANGE OF LIFE AND COUNTRY.</h4>

<p>My new acquaintance never ceased to congratulate
himself on what he called the lucky
accident that had led him to the barracks that
morning, and thus brought about our meeting.
"Little as you think of me, my dear," said he,
"I'm one of the Tiernays of Timmahoo myself;
faix, until I saw you, I thought I was the last
of them! There are eight generations of us in
the church-yard at Kells, and I was looking to
the time when they'd lay my bones there, as
the last of the race, but I see there's better fortune
before us."</p>

<p>"But you have a family I hope?"</p>

<p>"Sorrow one belonging to me. I might have
married when I was young, but there was a
pride in me to look for something higher than I
had any right, except from blood, I mean; for a
better stock than our own isn't to be found;
and that's the way years went over and I lost
the opportunity, and here I am now an old
bachelor, without one to stand to me, barrin' it
be yourself."</p>

<p>The last words were uttered with a tremulous
emotion, and on turning toward him I saw his
eyes swimming with tears, and perceived that
some strong feeling was working within him.</p>

<p>"You can't suppose I can ever forget what I
owe you, Mr. Tiernay."</p>

<p>"Call me Pat, Pat Tiernay," interrupted he,
roughly.</p>

<p>"I'll call you what you please," said I, "if
you let me add friend to it."</p>

<p>"That's enough; we understand one another
now, no more need be said; you'll come home
and live with me. It's not long, maybe, you'll
have to do that same; but when I go you'll be
heir to what I have: 'tis more, perhaps, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
many supposes, looking at the coat and the
gaiters I'm wearin'. Mind, Maurice, I don't
want you, nor I don't expect you to turn farmer
like myself. You need never turn a hand to
any thing. You'll have your horse to ride&mdash;two
if you like it. Your time will be all your own,
so that you spend a little of it, now and then,
with me, and as much divarsion as ever you
care for."</p>

<p>I have condensed into a few words the substance
of a conversation which lasted till we
reached Baldoyle; and passing through that not
over-imposing village, gained the neighborhood
of the sea-shore, along which stretched the farm
of the "Black Pits," a name derived, I was
told, from certain black holes that were dug in
the sands by fishermen in former times, when
the salt tide washed over the pleasant fields
where corn was now growing. A long, low,
thatched cabin, with far more indications of
room and comfort than pretension to the picturesque,
stood facing the sea. There were neither
trees nor shrubs around it, and the aspect of
the spot was bleak and cheerless enough, a
coloring a dark November day did nothing to
dispel.</p>

<p>It possessed one charm, however, and had it
been a hundred times inferior to what it was,
<i>that</i> one would have compensated for all else&mdash;hearty
welcome met me at the door, and the
words, "This is your home, Maurice," filled my
heart with happiness.</p>

<p>Were I to suffer myself to dwell even in
thought on this period of my life, I feel how insensibly
I should be led away into an inexcusable
prolixity. The little meaningless incidents of
my daily life, all so engraven on my memory
still, occupied me pleasantly from day till night.
Not only the master of myself and my own
time, I was master of every thing around me.
Uncle Pat, as he loved to call himself, treated
me with a degree of respect that was almost
painful to me, and only when we were alone
together, did he relapse into the intimacy of
equality. Two first-rate hunters stood in my
stable; a stout-built half-deck boat lay at my
command beside the quay; I had my gun and
my grayhounds; books, journals; every thing,
in short, that a liberal purse and a kind spirit
could confer&mdash;all but acquaintance. Of these
I possessed absolutely none. Too proud to descend
to intimacy with the farmers and small
shopkeepers of the neighborhood, my position
excluded me from acquaintance with the gentry;
and thus I stood between both, unknown to
either.</p>

<p>For a while my new career was too absorbing
to suffer me to dwell on this circumstance.
The excitement of field sports sufficed me when
abroad, and I came home usually so tired at
night that I could barely keep awake to amuse
Uncle Pat with those narratives of war and campaigning
he was so fond of hearing. To the
hunting-field succeeded the Bay of Dublin, and
I passed days, even weeks, exploring every creek
and inlet of the coast; now cruising under the
dark cliffs of the Welsh shore, or, while my boat
lay at anchor, wandering among the solitary
valleys of Lambay; my life, like a dream full
of its own imaginings, and unbroken by the
thoughts or feelings of others! I will not go
the length of saying that I was self-free from
all reproach on the inglorious indolence in which
my days were passed, or that my thoughts
never strayed away to that land where my first
dreams of ambition were felt. But a strange
fatuous kind of languor had grown upon me,
and the more I retired within myself, the less did
I wish for a return to that struggle with the
world which every active life engenders. Perhaps&mdash;I
can not now say if it were so&mdash;perhaps
I resented the disdainful distance with which
the gentry treated me, as we met in the hunting-field
or the coursing-ground. Some of the isolation
I preferred may have had this origin, but
choice had the greater share in it, until at last
my greatest pleasure was to absent myself for
weeks on a cruise, fancying that I was exploring
tracts never visited by man, and landing on
spots where no human foot had ever been known
to tread.</p>

<p>If Uncle Pat would occasionally remonstrate
on the score of these long absences, he never
ceased to supply means for them, and my sea
store and a well-filled purse were never wanting,
when the blue Peter floated from "La
Hoche," as in my ardor I had named my cutter.
Perhaps at heart he was not sorry to see me
avoid the capital and its society. The bitterness
which had succeeded the struggle for independence
was now at its highest point, and there
was what, to my thinking at least, appeared
something like the cruelty of revenge in the
sentences which followed the state trials. I
will not suffer myself to stray into the debatable
ground of politics, nor dare I give an opinion on
matters, where, with all the experience of fifty
years superadded, the wisest heads are puzzled
how to decide; but my impression at the time
was, that lenity would have been a safer and a
better policy than severity, and that in the momentary
prostration of the country lay the precise
conjuncture for those measures of grace
and favor, which were afterward rather wrung
from than conceded by the English government.
Be this as it may, Dublin offered a
strange spectacle at that period. The triumphant
joy of one party&mdash;the discomfiture and depression
of the other. All the exuberant delight
of success here; all the bitterness of failure
there. On one side festivities, rejoicings,
and public demonstrations; on the other, confinement,
banishment, or the scaffold.</p>

<p>The excitement was almost madness. The
passion for pleasure, restrained by the terrible
contingencies of the time, now broke forth with
redoubled force, and the capital was thronged
with all its rank, riches, and fashion, when its
jails were crowded, and the heaviest sentences
of the law were in daily execution. The state
trials were crowded by all the fashion of the
metropolis; and the heart-moving eloquence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Curran was succeeded by the strains of a merry
concert. It was just then, too, that the great
lyric poet of Ireland began to appear in society,
and those songs which were to be known afterwards
as "The Melodies," par excellence, were
first heard in all the witching enchantment
which his own taste and voice could lend
them. To such as were indifferent to or could
forget the past, it was a brilliant period. It
was the last flickering blaze of Irish nationality,
before the lamp was extinguished for ever.</p>

<p>Of this society I myself saw nothing. But
even in the retirement of my humble life the
sounds of its mirth and pleasure penetrated,
and I often wished to witness the scenes which
even in vague description were fascinating. It
was then in a kind of discontent at my exclusion,
that I grew from day to day more disposed
to solitude, and fonder of those excursions which
led me out of all reach of companionship or
acquaintance. In this spirit I planned a long
cruise down channel, resolving to visit the Island
of Valencia, or, if the wind and weather favored,
to creep around the southwest coast as far
as Bantry or Kenmare. A man and his son, a
boy of about sixteen, formed all my crew, and
were quite sufficient for the light tackle and
easy rig of my craft. Uncle Pat was already
mounted on his pony, and ready to set out for
market, as we prepared to start. It was a
bright spring morning&mdash;such a one as now and
then the changeful climate of Ireland brings
forth, in a brilliancy of color and softness of atmosphere
that are rare in even more favored
lands.</p>

<p>"You have a fine day of it, Maurice, and just
enough wind," said he, looking at the point
from whence it came. "I almost wish I was
going with you."</p>

<p>"And why not come, then?" asked I. "You
never will give yourself a holiday. Do so for
once, now."</p>

<p>"Not to-day, any how," said he, half sighing
at his self-denial. "I have a great deal of
business on my hands to-day; but the next
time&mdash;the very next you're up to a long cruise,
I'll go with you."</p>

<p>"That's a bargain, then?"</p>

<p>"A bargain. Here's my hand on it."</p>

<p>We shook hands cordially on the compact.
Little knew I it was to be for the last time, and
that we were never to meet again.</p>

<p>I was soon aboard, and with a free mainsail
skimming rapidly over the bright waters of the
bay. The wind freshened as the day wore on,
and we quickly passed the Kish light-ship, and
held our course boldly down channel. The
height of my enjoyment in these excursions
consisted in the unbroken quietude of mind I
felt, when removed from all chance of interruption,
and left free to follow out my own fancies,
and indulge my dreamy conceptions to my
heart's content. It was then I used to revel in
imaginings which sometimes soared into the
boldest realms of ambition, and at other
strayed contemplatively in the humblest walks
of obscure fortune. My crew never broke in
upon these musings; indeed old Tom Finnerty's
low crooning song rather aided than interrupted
them. He was not much given to talking, and
a chance allusion to some vessel afar off, or
some head-land we were passing, were about
the extent of his communicativeness, and even
these often fell on my ear unnoticed.</p>

<p>It was thus, at night, we made the Hook
Tower; and on the next day passed, in a spanking
breeze, under the bold cliffs of Tramore,
just catching, as the sun was sinking, the sight
of Youghal Bay, and the tall headlands beyond
it.</p>

<p>"The wind is drawing more to the nor'ard,"
said old Tom, as night closed in, "and the
clouds look dirty."</p>

<p>"Bear her up a point or two," said I, "and
let us stand in for Cork harbor, if it comes on to
blow."</p>

<p>He muttered something in reply, but I did
not catch the words, nor, indeed, cared I to hear
them, for I had just wrapped myself in my
boat-cloak, and stretched at full length on the
shingle ballast of the yawl, was gazing in rapture
at the brilliancy of the starry sky above
me. Light skiffs of feathery cloud would now
and then flit past, and a peculiar hissing sound of
the sea told, at the same time, that the breeze
was freshening. But old Tom had done his
duty in mentioning this once; and thus having
disburdened his conscience, he closehauled his
mainsail, shifted the ballast a little to midships,
and, putting up the collar of his pilot-coat,
screwed himself tighter into the corner beside
the tiller, and chewed his quid in quietness.
The boy slept soundly in the bow, and I, lulled
by the motion and the plashing waves, fell into
a dreamy stupor, like a pleasant sleep. The
pitching of the boat continued to increase, and
twice or thrice, struck by a heavy sea, she lay
over, till the white waves came tumbling in
over her gunwale. I heard Tom call to his boy,
something about the head-sail, but for the life
of me I could not or would not arouse myself
from a train of thought that I was following.</p>

<p>"She's a stout boat to stand this," said
Tom, as he rounded her off, at a coming wave,
which, even thus escaped, splashed over her like
a cataract. "I know many a bigger craft
wouldn't hold up her canvas under such a
gale."</p>

<p>"Here it comes, father. Here's a squall,"
cried the boy, and with a crash like thunder,
the wind struck the sail, and laid the boy half-under.</p>

<p>"She'd float if she was full of water," said
the old man, as the craft "righted."</p>

<p>"But maybe the spars wouldn't stand," said
the boy, anxiously.</p>

<p>"'Tis what I'm thinking," rejoined the
father. "There's a shake in the mast, below
the caps."</p>

<p>"Tell him it's better to bear up, and go before
it," whispered the lad, with a gesture toward
where I was lying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Troth it's little he'd care," said the other;
"besides, he's never plazed to be woke up."</p>

<p>"Here it comes again," cried the boy. But
this time the squall swept past ahead of us, and
the craft only reeled to the swollen waves, as
they tore by.</p>

<p>"We'd better go about, sir," said Tom to
me; "there's a heavy sea outside, and it's
blowing hard now."</p>

<p>"And there's a split in the mast as long as
my arm," cried the boy.</p>

<p>"I thought she'd live through any sea,
Tom!" said I, laughing; for it was his constant
boast that no weather could harm her.</p>

<p>"There goes the spar," shouted he, while
with a loud snap the mast gave way, and fell
with a crash over the side. The boat immediately
came head to wind, and sea after sea
broke upon her bow, and fell in great floods over
us.</p>

<p>"Cut away the stays&mdash;clear the wreck,"
cried Tom, "before the squall catches her."</p>

<p>And although we now labored like men whose
lives depended on the exertion, the trailing sail
and heavy rigging, shifting the ballast as they
fell, laid her completely over; and when the
first sea struck her, over she went. The violence
of the gale sent me a considerable distance out,
and for several seconds I felt as though I should
never reach the surface again. Wave after
wave rolled over me, and seemed bearing me
downward with their weight. At last I
grasped something; it was a rope&mdash;a broken
halyard&mdash;but by its means I gained the mast,
which floated alongside of the yawl as she now
lay keel uppermost. With what energy did I
struggle to reach her. The space was scarcely
a dozen feet, and yet it cost me what seemed
an age to traverse. Through all the roaring of
the breakers, and the crashing sounds of storm,
I thought I could hear my comrades' voices
shouting and screaming, but this was in all
likelihood a mere deception, for I never saw
them more.</p>

<p>Grasping with a death-grip the slippery keel,
I hung on the boat through all the night. The
gale continued to increase, and by day-break it
blew a perfect hurricane. With an aching anxiety
I watched for the light to see if I were near
the land, or if any ship were in sight, but when
the sun rose nothing met my eyes but a vast
expanse of waves tumbling and tossing in mad
confusion, while overhead some streaked and
mottled clouds were hurried along with the
wind. Happily for me, I have no correct memory
of that long day of suffering. The continual
noise, but more still, the incessant motion of
the sea and sky around brought on a vertigo,
that seemed like madness; and although the
instinct of self-preservation remained, the wildest
and most incoherent fancies filled my brain.
Some of these were powerful enough to impress
themselves upon my memory for years after,
and one I have never yet been able to dispel. It
clings to me in every season of unusual depression
or dejection; it recurs in the half nightmare
sleep of over fatigue, and even invades
me when, restless and feverish, I lie for hours
incapable of repose. This is the notion that
my state was one of after-life punishment; that
I had died, and was now expiating a sinful life
by the everlasting misery of a castaway. The
fever brought on by thirst and exhaustion and
the burning sun which beamed down upon my
uncovered head, soon completed the measure of
this infatuation, and all sense and guidance left
me.</p>

<p>By what instinctive impulse I still held on
my grasp I can not explain, but there I clung
during the whole of that long dreadful day,
and the still more dreadful night, when the
piercing cold cramped my limbs, and seemed as
if freezing the very blood within me. It was
no wish for life; it was no anxiety to save myself
that now filled me. It seemed like a vague
impulse of necessity that compelled me to hang
on. It was, as it were, part of that terrible
sentence which made this my doom forever!</p>

<p>An utter unconsciousness must have followed
this state, and a dreary blank, with flitting
shapes of suffering, is all that remains to my
recollection....</p>

<p>Probably within the whole range of human
sensations, there is not one so perfect in its calm
and soothing influence as the first burst of gratitude
we feel when recovering from a long and
severe illness! There is not an object, however
humble and insignificant, that is not for the
time invested with a new interest. The air is
balmier, flowers are sweeter, the voices of friends,
the smiles and kind looks, are dearer and fonder
than we have ever known them. The whole
world has put on a new aspect for us, and we
have not a thought that is not teeming with
forgiveness and affection. Such, in all their
completeness, were my feelings as I lay on the
poop-deck of a large three-masted ship, which,
with studding and top-gallant sails all set,
proudly held her course up the Gulf of St.
Lawrence.</p>

<p>She was a Dantzig barque, the "Hoffnung,"
bound for Quebec, her only passengers being a
Moravian minister and his wife, on their way to
join a small German colony established near
Lake Champlain. To Gottfried Kr&ouml;ller and his
dear little wife I owe not life alone, but nearly
all that has made it valuable. With means
barely removed from absolute poverty, I found
that they had spared nothing to assist in my
recovery; for, when discovered, emaciation and
wasting had so far reduced me that nothing but
the most unremitting care and kindness could
have succeeded in restoring me. To this end
they bestowed not only their whole time and attention,
but every little delicacy of their humble
sea-store. All the little cordials and restoratives
meant for a season of sickness or debility
were lavished unsparingly on me, and every instinct
of national thrift and carefulness gave
way before the more powerful influence of
Christian benevolence.</p>

<p>I can think of nothing but that bright morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
as I lay on a mattress on the deck, with the
"Pfarrer" on one side of me, and his good little
wife, Lyschen, on the other; he, with his volume
of "Wieland," and she working away with her
long knitting-needles, and never raising her
head save to bestow a glance at the poor sick
boy, whose bloodless lips were trying to mutter
her name in thankfulness. It is like the most
delicious dream as I think over those hours,
when, rocked by the surging motion of the
large ship, hearing in half distinctness the words
of the "Pfarrer's" reading, I followed out little
fancies&mdash;now self-originating, now rising from
the theme of the poet's musings.</p>

<p>How softly the cloud shadows moved over the
white sails and swept along the bright deck!
How pleasantly the water rippled against the
vessel's side! With what a glad sound the
great ensign flapped and fluttered in the breeze!
There was light, and life, and motion on every
side, and I felt all the intoxication of enjoyment.</p>

<p>And like a dream was the portion of my life
which followed. I accompanied the Pfarrer to
a small settlement near "Crown Point," where
he was to take up his residence as minister.
Here we lived amid a population of about four
or five hundred Germans, principally from Pomerania,
on the shores of the Baltic, a peaceful,
thrifty, quiet set of beings, who, content with
the little interests revolving around themselves,
never troubled their heads about the great events
of war or politics; and here in all likelihood
should I have been content to pass my days,
when an accidental journey I made to Albany,
to receive some letters for the Pfarrer, once more
turned the fortune of my life.</p>

<p>It was a great incident in the quiet monotony
of my life, when I set out one morning, arrayed
in a full suit of coarse glossy black, with
buttons like small saucers, and a hat whose
brim almost protected my shoulders. I was,
indeed, an object of very considerable envy to
some, and I hope, also, not denied the admiring
approval of some others. Had the respectable
city I was about to visit been the chief metropolis
of a certain destination which I must not
name, the warnings I received about its dangers,
dissipations, and seductions, could scarcely have
been more earnest or impressive. I was neither
to speak with, nor even to look at, those I met
in the streets. I was carefully to avoid taking
my meals at any of the public eating-houses,
rigidly guarding myself from the contamination
of even a chance acquaintance. It was deemed
as needless to caution me against theatres or
places of amusement, as to hint to me that I
should not commit a highway robbery or a
murder, and so, in sooth, I should myself have
felt it. The patriarchal simplicity in which I
had lived for above a year, had not been without
its effect in subduing exaggerated feeling, or
controlling that passion for excitement so common
to youth. I felt a kind of drowsy, dreamy
languor over me, which I sincerely believed represented
a pious and well-regulated temperament.
Perhaps in time it might have become
such. Perhaps with others, more happily constituted,
the impression would have been confirmed
and fixed; but in <i>my</i> case it was a mere lacker
that the first rubbing in the world was sure to
brush off.</p>

<p>I arrived safely at Albany, and having presented
myself at the bank of Gabriel Shultze,
was desired to call the following morning, when
all the letters and papers of Gottfried Kr&ouml;ller
should be delivered to me. A very cold invitation
to supper was the only hospitality extended
to me. This I declined on pretext of weariness,
and set out to explore the town, to which
my long residence in rural life imparted a high
degree of interest.</p>

<p>I don't know what it may now be: doubtless
a great capital, like one of the European cities;
but at the time I speak of, Albany was a strange,
incongruous assemblage of stores and wooden
houses, great buildings like granaries, with
whole streets of low sheds around them, where
open to the passer-by, men worked at various
trades, and people followed out the various
duties of domestic life in sight of the public; the
daughters knitted and sewed; mothers cooked
and nursed their children; men ate, and worked,
and smoked, and sang, as if in all the
privacy of closed dwellings, while a thick current
of population poured by, apparently too
much immersed in their own cares, or too
much accustomed to the scene, to give it more
than passing notice.</p>

<p>It was curious how one bred and born in the
great city of Paris, with all its sights and
sounds, and scenes of excitement and display,
could have been so rusticated by time, as to
feel a lively interest in surveying the motley
aspect of this quaint town. There were, it is
true, features in the picture very unlike the
figures in "Old World" landscape. A group
of red men, seated around a fire in the open
street, or a squaw carrying on her back a baby,
firmly tied to a piece of curved bark; a Southern-stater,
with a spanking wagon-team, and
two grinning negroes behind, were new and
strange elements in the life of a city. Still,
the mere movement, the actual busy stir and
occupation of the inhabitants, attracted me as
much as any thing else; and the shops and
stalls where trades were carried on were a
seduction I could not resist.</p>

<p>The strict puritanism in which I had lately
lived taught me to regard all these things with
a certain degree of distrust. They were the
impulses of that gold-seeking passion of which
Gottfried had spoken so frequently; they were
the great vice of that civilization, whose luxurious
tendency he often deplored; and here, now,
more than one-half around me were arts that
only ministered to voluptuous tastes. Brilliant
articles of jewelry; gay cloaks, worked with
wampum, in Indian taste; ornamental turning,
and costly weapons, inlaid with gold and silver,
succeeded each other, street after street; and
the very sight of them, however pleasurable to
the eye, set me a-moralizing, in a strain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
would have done credit to a son of Geneva. It
might have been, that in my enthusiasm I
uttered half aloud what I intended for soliloquy:
or perhaps some gesture, or peculiarity
of manner, had the effect; but so it was: I
found myself an object of notice; and my queer-cut
coat and wide hat, contrasting so strangely
with my youthful appearance and slender make,
drew many a criticism on me.</p>

<p>"He ain't a Quaker, that's a fact," cried
one, "for they don't wear black."</p>

<p>"He's a down-Easter&mdash;a horse jockey chap,
I'll be bound," cried another. "They put on
all manner of disguises and 'masqueroonings.'
I know 'em!"</p>

<p>"He's a calf preacher&mdash;a young bottle-nosed
Gospeller," broke in a thick, short fellow, like
the skipper of a merchant ship. "Let's have
him out for a preachment."</p>

<p>"Ay, you're right," chimed in another. "I'll
get you a sugar hogshead in no time;" and
away he ran on the mission.</p>

<p>Between twenty and thirty persons had now
collected; and I saw myself, to my unspeakable
shame and mortification, the centre of all
their looks and speculations. A little more
<i>aplomb</i> or knowledge of life would have taught
me coolness enough in a few words to undeceive
them: but such a task was far above me now;
and I saw nothing for it but flight. Could I
only have known which way to take, I need not
have feared any pursuer, for I was a capital
runner, and in high condition; but of the
locality I was utterly ignorant, and should only
surrender myself to mere chance. With a bold
rush, then, I dashed right through the crowd,
and set off down the street, the whole crew
after me. The dusk of the closing evening was
in my favor; and although volunteers were
enlisted in the chase at every corner and turning,
I distanced them, and held on my way in
advance. My great object being not to turn
on my course, lest I should come back to my
starting point, I directed my steps nearly
straight onward, clearing apple-stalls and fruit
tables at a bound; and more than once taking
a flying leap over an Indian's fire, when the
mad shout of the red man would swell the
chorus that followed me. At last I reached a
network of narrow lanes and alleys, by turning
and winding through which, I speedily found
myself in a quiet secluded spot, with here and
there a flickering candle-light from the windows,
but no other sign of habitation. I looked anxiously
about for an open door; but they were
all safe barred and fastened; and it was only
on turning a corner I spied what seemed to me
a little shop, with a solitary lamp over the entrance.
A narrow canal, crossed by a rickety
old bridge, led to this; and the moment I had
crossed over, I seized the single plank which
formed the footway, and shoved it into the
stream. My retreat being thus secured, I
opened the door, and entered. It was a barber's
shop; at least, so a great chair before a
cracked old looking glass, with some well-worn
combs and brushes, bespoke it; but the place
seemed untenanted, and although I called aloud
several times, none came or responded to my
summons.</p>

<p>I now took a survey of the spot which seemed
of the poorest imaginable. A few empty
pomatum pots, a case of razors that might have
defied the most determined suicide, and a half-finished
wig, on a block painted like a red man,
were the entire stock in trade. On the walls,
however, were some colored prints of the battles
of the French army in Germany and Italy.
Execrably done things they were, but full of
meaning and interest to my eyes in spite of
that. With all the faults of drawing and all
the travesties of costume, I could recognize
different corps of the service, and my heart
bounded as I gazed on the tall shakos swarming
to a breach, or the loose jacket as it floated
from the hussar in a charge. All the wild
pleasures of soldiering rose once more to my
mind, and I thought over old comrades who
doubtless were now earning the high rewards of
their bravery in the great career of glory. And
as I did so, my own image confronted me in the
glass, as with long, lank hair, and a great
bolster of a white cravat, I stood before it.
What a contrast!&mdash;how unlike the smart hussar,
with curling locks and fierce mustache!
Was I as much changed in heart as in looks.
Had my spirit died out within me. Would the
proud notes of the bugle or the trumpet fall
meaningless on my ears, or the hoarse cry of
"Charge!" send no bursting fullness to my
temples? Ay, even these coarse representations
stirred the blood in my veins, and my
step grew firmer as I walked the room.</p>

<p>In a passionate burst of enthusiasm I tore off
my slouched hat and hurled it from me. It
felt like the badge of some ignoble slavery, and
I determined to endure it no longer. The noise
of the act called up a voice from the inner room,
and a man, to all appearance suddenly roused
from sleep, stood at the door. He was evidently
young, but poverty, dissipation, and raggedness
made the question of his age a difficult one to
solve. A light-colored mustache and beard
covered all the lower part of his face, and his
long blonde hair fell heavily over his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well," cried he, half angrily, "what's the
matter; are you so impatient that you must
smash the furniture?"</p>

<p>Although the words were spoken as correctly
as I have written them, they were uttered with
a foreign accent; and, hazarding the stroke, I
answered him in French by apologizing for the
noise.</p>

<p>"What! a Frenchman," exclaimed he, "and
in that dress; what can that mean?"</p>

<p>"If you'll shut your door, and cut off pursuit
of me, I'll tell you every thing," said I, "for I
hear the voices of people coming down that
street in front."</p>

<p>"I'll do better," said he, quickly, "I'll upset
the bridge, and they can not come over."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's done already," replied I; "I shoved
it into the stream as I passed."</p>

<p>He looked at me steadily for a moment without
speaking, and then approaching close to me,
said, "Parbleu! the act was very unlike your
costume!" At the same time he shut the
door, and drew a strong bar across it. This
done, he turned to me once more&mdash;"Now for
it: who are you, and what has happened to
you?"</p>

<p>"As to what I am," replied I, imitating his
own abruptness, "my dress will almost save
the trouble of explaining; these Albany folk,
however, would make a field-preacher of me,
and to escape them I took to flight."</p>

<p>"Well, if a fellow will wear his hair that
fashion, he must take the consequence," said
he, drawing out my long lank locks as they
hung over my shoulders. "And so you wouldn't
hold forth for them; not even give them a stave
of a conventical chant." He kept his eyes riveted
on me as he spoke, and then seizing two
pieces of stick for the firewood, he beat on the
table the ran-tan-plan of the French drum.
"That's the music you know best, lad, eh?&mdash;that's
the air, which, if it has not led heavenward,
has conducted many a brave fellow out
of this world at least: do you forget it?"</p>

<p>"Forget it! no," cried I; "but who are
you; and how comes it that&mdash;that&mdash;" I stopped
in confusion at the rudeness of the question
I had begun.</p>

<p>"That I stand here, half-fed, and all but
naked; a barber in a land where men don't
shave once a month. Parbleu! they'd come
even seldomer to my shop if they knew how
tempted I feel to draw the razor sharp and
quick across the gullet of a fellow with a well-stocked
pouch."</p>

<p>As he continued to speak, his voice assumed
a tone and cadence that sounded familiarly to
my ears as I stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Not know me yet," exclaimed he, laughing;
"and yet all this poverty and squalor
isn't as great a disguise as your own, Tiernay.
Come, lad, rub your eyes a bit, and try if you
can't recognize an old comrade."</p>

<p>"I know you, yet can not remember how or
where we met," said I, in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I'll refresh your memory," said he, crossing
his arms, and drawing himself proudly up.
"If you can trace back in your mind to a certain
hot and dusty day, on the Metz road, when
you, a private in the seventh Hussars, were eating
an onion and a slice of black bread for your
dinner, a young officer, well-looking and well-mounted,
cantered up, and threw you his brandy
flask. Your acknowledgment of the civility
showed you to be a gentleman; and the acquaintance
thus opened, soon ripened into intimacy."</p>

<p>"But he was the young Marquis de Saint
Trone," said I, perfectly remembering the incident.</p>

<p>"Or Eugene Santron, of the republican army,
or the barber at Albany, without any name at
all," said he, laughing. "What, Maurice, don't
you know me yet?"</p>

<p>"What, the lieutenant of my regiment!
The dashing officer of Hussars!"</p>

<p>"Just so, and as ready to resume the old
skin as ever," cried he, "and brandish a weapon
somewhat longer, and perhaps somewhat
sharper, too, than a razor."</p>

<p>We shook hands with all the cordiality of
old comrades, meeting far away from home,
and in a land of strangers; and although each
was full of curiosity to learn the other's history,
a kind of reserve held back the inquiry,
till Santron said, "My confession is soon made,
Maurice; I left the service in the Meuse, to
escape being shot. One day, on returning from a
field man&oelig;uvre, I discovered that my portmanteau
had been opened, and a number of letters
and papers taken out. They were part of a
correspondence I held with old General Lamarre,
about the restoration of the Bourbons, a
subject, I'm certain, that half the officers in the
army were interested in, and, even to Bonaparte
himself, deeply implicated in too. No matter,
<i>my</i> treason, as they called it, was too flagrant,
and I had just twenty minutes' start of the
order which was issued for my arrest, to make
my escape into Holland. There I managed to
pass several months in various disguises, part
of the time being employed as a Dutch spy,
and actually charged with an order to discover
tidings of myself, until I finally got away in an
Antwerp schooner, to New York. From that
time my life has been nothing but a struggle,
a hard one, too, with actual want, for in this
land of enterprise and activity, mere intelligence,
without some craft or calling, will do
nothing.</p>

<p>"I tried fifty things&mdash;to teach riding, and
when I mounted into the saddle, I forgot everything
but my own enjoyment, and caracolled,
and plunged, and passaged, till the poor beast
hadn't a leg to stand on; fencing, and I got
into a duel with a rival teacher, and ran him
through the neck, and was obliged to fly from
Halifax; French, I made love to my pupil, a
pretty looking Dutch fraulein, whose father
didn't smile on our affection; and so on I descended
from a dancing-master to a waiter, a
<i>laquais de place</i>, and at last settled down as a
barber, which brilliant speculation I had just
determined to abandon this very night; for to-morrow
morning, Maurice, I start for New York
and France again; ay, boy, and you'll go with
me. This is no land for either of us."</p>

<p>"But I have found happiness, at least contentment,
here," said I, gravely.</p>

<p>"What! play the hypocrite with an old comrade!
shame on you, Maurice," cried he. "It
is these confounded locks have perverted the
boy," added he, jumping up; and before I
knew what he was about, he had shorn my
hair, in two quick cuts of the scissors, close to
the head. "There," said he, throwing the cut-off
hair toward me, "there lies all your saintship;
depend upon it, boy, they'd hunt you out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of the settlement if you came back to them
cropped in this fashion."</p>

<p>"But you return to certain death, Santron,"
said I; "your crime is too recent to be forgiven
or forgotten."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; Fouche, Cassaubon, and a
dozen others now in office, were deeper than I
was. There's not a public man in France
could stand an exposure, or hazard recrimination.
It's a thieves' amnesty at this moment,
and I must not lose the opportunity. I'll show
you letters that will prove it, Maurice; for,
poor and ill-fed as I am, I like life just as well
as ever I did. I mean to be a general of division
one of these days, and so will you too, lad,
if there's any spirit left in you."</p>

<p>Thus did Santron rattle on, sometimes of
himself and his own future; sometimes discussing
mine; for while talking, he had contrived
to learn all the chief particulars of my history,
from the time of my sailing from La Rochelle
for Ireland.</p>

<p>The unlucky expedition afforded him great
amusement, and he was never weary of laughing
at all our adventures and mischances in
Ireland. Of Humbert, he spoke as a fourth or
fifth-rate man, and actually shocked me by all
the heresies he uttered against our generals,
and the plan of campaign; but, perhaps, I
could have borne even these better than the
sarcasms and sneers at the little life of "the
settlement." He treated all my efforts at defense
as mere hypocrisy, and affected to regard
me as a mere knave, that had traded on the
confiding kindness of these simple villagers. I
could not undeceive him on this head; nor
what was more, could I satisfy my own conscience
that he was altogether in the wrong;
for, with a diabolical ingenuity, he had contrived
to hit on some of the most vexatious doubts
which disturbed my mind, and instinctively to
detect the secret cares and difficulties that beset
me. The lesson should never be lost on us,
that the devil was depicted as a sneerer! I
verily believe the powers of temptation have no
such advocacy as sarcasm. Many can resist
the softest seductions of vice: many are proof
against all the blandishments of mere enjoyment,
come in what shape it will; but how
few can stand firm against the assaults of clever
irony, or hold fast to their convictions when
assailed by the sharp shafts of witty depreciation.</p>

<p>I'm ashamed to own how little I could oppose
to all his impertinences about our village,
and its habits; or how impossible I found it
not to laugh at his absurd descriptions of a life
which, without having ever witnessed, he depicted
with a rare accuracy. He was shrewd
enough not to push this ridicule offensively, and
long before I knew it I found myself regarding,
with his eyes, a picture in which, but a few
months back, I stood as a fore-ground figure. I
ought to confess, that no artificial aid was derived
from either good cheer, or the graces of
hospitality; we sat by a miserable lamp, in a
wretchedly cold chamber, our sole solace some
bad cigars, and a can of flat, stale cider.</p>

<p>"I have not a morsel to offer you to eat,
Maurice, but to-morrow we'll breakfast on my
razors, dine on that old looking-glass, and sup
on two hard brushes and the wig!"</p>

<p>Such were the brilliant pledges, and we closed
a talk which the flickering lamp at last put an
end to.</p>

<p>A broken, unconnected conversation followed
for a little time, but at length, worn out and
wearied, each dropped off to sleep&mdash;Eugene on
the straw settle, and I in the old chair&mdash;never
to awake till the bright sun was streaming in
between the shutters, and dancing merrily on
the tiled floor.</p>

<p>An hour before I awoke he had completed
the sale of all his little stock in trade, and, with
a last look round the spot where he had passed
some months of struggling poverty, out we sallied
into the town.</p>

<p>"We'll breakfast at Jonathan Hone's," said
Santron. "It's the first place here. I'll treat
you to rump steaks, pumpkin pie, and a gin
twister that will astonish you. Then, while
I'm arranging for our passage down the Hudson,
you'll see the hospitable banker, and tell
him how to forward all his papers, and so forth,
to the settlement, with your respectful compliments
and regrets, and the rest of it."</p>

<p>"But am I to take leave of them in this
fashion?" asked I.</p>

<p>"Without you want <i>me</i> to accompany you
there, I think it's by far the best way," said
he, laughingly. "If, however, you think that
my presence and companionship will add any
lustre to your position, say the word and I'm
ready. I know enough of the barber's craft
now to make up a head 'en Puritan,' and, if
you wish, I'll pledge myself to impose upon the
whole colony."</p>

<p>Here was a threat there was no mistaking;
and any imputation of ingratitude on my part
were far preferable to the thought of such an
indignity. He saw his advantage at once, and
boldly declared that nothing should separate
us.</p>

<p>"The greatest favor, my dear Maurice, you
can ever expect at my hands is, never to speak
of this freak of yours; or, if I do, to say that
you performed the part to perfection."</p>

<p>My mind was in one of those moods of change
when the slightest impulse is enough to sway
it, and more from this cause than all his persuasion,
I yielded; and the same evening saw
me gliding down the Hudson, and admiring the
bold Kaatskills, on our way to New York.</p>

<h2>ANECDOTES OF PAGANINI.</h2>


<p>Paganini was in all respects a very singular
being, and an interesting subject to study.
His talents were by no means confined to his
wonderful powers as a musician. On other
subjects he was well-informed, acute, and conversible,
of bland and gentle manners, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
society, perfectly well-bred. All this contrasted
strangely with the dark, mysterious stories
which were bruited abroad, touching some passages
in his early life. But outward semblance
and external deportment are treacherous as
quicksands, when taken as guides by which to
sound the real depths of human character.
Lord Byron remarks, that his pocket was once
picked by the civilest gentleman he ever conversed
with, and that by far the mildest individual
of his acquaintance was the remorseless
Ali Pacha of Yanina. The expressive lineaments
of Paganini told a powerful tale of
passions which had been fearfully excited, which
might be roused again from temporary slumber,
or were exhausted by indulgence and premature
decay, leaving deep furrows to mark their
intensity. Like the generality of his countrymen,
he looked much older than he was. With
them, the elastic vigor of youth and manhood
rapidly subsides into an interminable and joyless
old age, numbering as many years, but with far
less both of physical and mental faculty to
render them endurable, than the more equally
poised gradations of our northern clime. It is
by no means unusual to encounter a well developed
Italian, whiskered to the eye-brows,
and "bearded like the pard," who tells you, to
your utter astonishment, that he is scarcely
seventeen, when you have set him down from
his appearance as, at least, five-and-thirty.</p>

<p>The following extract from Colonel Montgomery
Maxwell's book of Military Reminiscences,
entitled "My Adventures," dated Genoa,
February 22d, 1815, supplies the earliest record
which has been given to the public respecting
Paganini, and affords authentic evidence that
some of the mysterious tales which heralded his
coming were not without foundation. He could
scarcely have been at this time thirty years old.
"Talking of music, I have become acquainted
with the most <i>outr&eacute;</i>, most extravagant, and
strangest character I ever beheld, or heard, in
the musical line. He has just been emancipated
from durance vile, where he has been for
a long time incarcerated on suspicion of murder.
His long figure, long neck, long face, and long
forehead; his hollow and deadly pale cheek,
large black eye, hooked nose, and jet black hair,
which is long, and more than half hiding his
expressive Jewish face; all these rendered him
the most extraordinary person I ever beheld.
There is something scriptural in the <i>tout ensemble</i>
of the strange physiognomy of this uncouth
and unearthly figure. Not that, as in
times of old, he plays, as Holy Writ tells us, on
a ten-stringed instrument; on the contrary, he
brings the most powerful, the most wonderful,
and the most heart-rending tones from one
string. His name is Paganini; he is very
improvident and very poor. The D&mdash;&mdash;s, and
the Impressario of the theatre got up a concert
for him the other night, which was well attended,
and on which occasion he electrified the
audience. He is a native of Genoa, and if I
were a judge of violin playing, I would pronounce
him the most surprising performer in the
world!"</p>

<p>That Paganini was either innocent of the
charge for which he suffered the incarceration
Colonel Maxwell mentions, or that it could not
be proved against him, may be reasonably inferred
from the fact that he escaped the galleys
or the executioner. In Italy, there was then,
<i>par excellence</i> (whatever there may be now), a
law for the rich, and another for the poor. As
he was without money, and unable to buy immunity,
it is charitable to suppose he was entitled
to it from innocence. A nobleman, with
a few <i>zecchini</i>, was in little danger of the law,
which confined its practice entirely to the lower
orders. I knew a Sicilian prince, who most
wantonly blew a vassal's brains out, merely
because he put him in a passion. The case
was not even inquired into. He sent half a
dollar to the widow of the defunct (which, by
the way, he borrowed from me, and never repaid),
and there the matter ended. Lord Nelson
once suggested to Ferdinand IV. of Naples, to
try and check the daily increase of assassination,
by a few salutary executions. "No, no," replied
old Nasone, who was far from being as
great a fool as he looked, "that is impossible.
If I once began that system, my kingdom would
soon be depopulated. One half my subjects
would be continually employed in hanging the
remainder."</p>

<p>Among other peculiarities, Paganini was an
incarnation of avarice and parsimony, with a
most contradictory passion for gambling. He
would haggle with you for sixpence, and stake
a rouleau on a single turn at <i>rouge et noir</i>. He
screwed you down in a bargain as tightly as if
you were compressed in a vice; yet he had
intervals of liberality, and sometimes did a
generous action. In this he bore some resemblance
to the celebrated John Elwes, of miserly
notoriety, who deprived himself of the common
necessaries of life, and lived on a potato skin,
but sometimes gave a check for &pound;100 to a
public charity, and contributed largely to private
subscriptions. I never heard that Paganini
actually did this, but once or twice he played
for nothing, and sent a donation to the Mendicity,
when he was in Dublin.</p>

<p>When he made his engagement with me, we
mutually agreed to write no orders, expecting
the house to be quite full every night, and both
being aware that the "sons of freedom," while
they add nothing to the exchequer, seldom assist
the effect of the performance. They are not
given to applaud vehemently; or, as Richelieu
observes, "in the right places." What we can
get for nothing we are inclined to think much
less of than that which we must purchase. He
who invests a shilling will not do it rashly, or
without feeling convinced that value received
will accrue from the risk. The man who pays
is the real enthusiast; he comes with a predetermination
to be amused, and his spirit is
exalted accordingly. Paganini's valet surprised
me one morning, by walking into my room, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
with many "<i>eccellenzas</i>" and gesticulations of
respect, asking me to give him an order. I
said, "Why do you come to me? Apply to
your master&mdash;won't he give you one?" "Oh,
yes; but I don't like to ask him." "Why
not?" "Because he'll stop the amount out of
my wages!" My heart relented; I gave him
the order, and paid Paganini the dividend. I
told him what it was, thinking, as a matter of
course, he would return it. He seemed uncertain
for a moment, paused, smiled sardonically,
looked at the three and sixpence, and with a
spasmodic twitch, deposited it in his own waistcoat
pocket instead of mine. Voltaire says,
"no man is a hero to his valet de chambre,"
meaning, thereby, as I suppose, that being behind
the scenes of every-day life, he finds out
that Marshal Saxe, or Frederick the Great, is as
subject to the common infirmities of our nature,
as John Nokes or Peter Styles. Whether
Paganini's squire of the body looked on his
master as a hero, in the vulgar acceptation of
the word, I can not say, but in spite of his
stinginess, which he writhed under, he regarded
him with mingled reverence and terror. "A
strange person, your master," observed I.
"<i>Signor</i>," replied the faithful Sancho Panza,
"<i>e veramente grand uomo, ma da non potersi
comprendere</i>." "He is truly a great man, but
quite incomprehensible." It was edifying to observe
the awful importance with which Antonio
bore the instrument nightly intrusted to his
charge to carry to and from the theatre. He
considered it an animated something, whether
d&aelig;mon or angel he was unable to determine,
but this he firmly believed, that it could speak
in actual dialogue when his master pleased, or
become a dumb familiar by the same controlling
volition. This especial violin was Paganini's
inseparable companion. It lay on his table
before him as he sat meditating in his solitary
chamber; it was placed by his side at dinner,
and on a chair within his reach when in bed. If
he woke, as he constantly did, in the dead of
night, and the sudden <i>estro</i> of inspiration seized
him, he grasped his instrument, started up, and
on the instant perpetuated the conception which
otherwise he would have lost forever. This
marvelous Cremona, valued at four hundred
guineas, Paganini, on his death-bed, gave to De
Kontski, his nephew and only pupil, himself an
eminent performer, and in his possession it now
remains.</p>

<p>When Paganini was in Dublin at the musical
festival of 1830, the Marquis of Anglesea, then
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, came every night
to the concerts at the theatre, and was greatly
pleased with his performance. On the first evening,
between the acts, his Excellency desired
that he might be brought round to his box to
be introduced, and paid him many compliments.
Lord Anglesea was at that time residing in perfect
privacy with his family, at Sir Harcourt
Lees' country house, near Blackrock, and expressed
a wish to get an evening from the great
violinist, to gratify his domestic circle. The
negotiation was rather a difficult one, as Paganini
was, of all others, the man who did nothing,
in the way of business, without an explicit
understanding, and a clearly-defined con-sid-e-ra-ti-on.
He was alive to the advantage
of honor, but he loved money with a paramount
affection. I knew that he had received enormous
terms, such as &pound;150 and &pound;200 for fiddling
at private parties in London, and I trembled
for the viceregal purse; but I undertook to
manage the affair, and went to work accordingly.
The aid-de-camp in waiting called with
me on Paganini, was introduced in due form,
and handed him a card of invitation to dinner,
which, of course, he received and accepted with
ceremonious politeness. Soon after the officer
had departed, he said, suddenly, "This is a great
honor, but am I expected to bring my instrument?"
"Oh, yes," I replied, "as a matter
of course&mdash;the Lord Lieutenant's family wish
to hear you in private." "<i>Caro amico</i>," rejoined
he, with petrifying composure, "<i>Paganini
con violino &eacute; Paganini senza violino,&mdash;ecco due
animali distinti</i>." "Paganini with his fiddle,
and Paganini without it, are two very different
persons." I knew perfectly what he meant,
and said, "The Lord Lieutenant is a nobleman
of exalted rank and character, liberal in the extreme,
but he is not Cr&oelig;sus; nor do I think
you could, with any consistency, receive such
an honor as dining at his table, and afterward
send in a bill for playing two or three tunes in
the evening." He was staggered; and asked,
"What do you advise?" I said, "Don't you
think a present, in the shape of a ring, or a
snuff-box, or something of that sort, with a
short inscription, would be a more agreeable
mode of settlement?" He seemed tickled by
this suggestion, and closed with it at once. I
dispatched the intelligence through the proper
channel, that the violin and the <i>gran maestro</i>
would both be in attendance. He went in his
very choicest mood, made himself extremely
agreeable, played away, unsolicited, throughout
the evening, to the delight of the whole party;
and on the following morning, a gold snuff-box
was duly presented to him, with a few complimentary
words engraved on the lid.</p>

<p>A year or two after this, when Paganini was
again in England, I thought another engagement
might be productive, as his extraordinary
attraction appeared still to increase. I wrote
to him on the subject, and soon received a very
courteous communication, to the effect, that,
although he had not contemplated including
Ireland in his tour, yet he had been so impressed
by the urbanity of the Dublin public, and
had, moreover, conceived such a personal esteem
for my individual character, that he might be
induced to alter his plans, at some inconvenience,
provided always I could make him a
more enticing proposal than the former one. I
was here completely puzzled, as, on that occasion,
I gave him a clear two-thirds of each receipt,
with a bonus of &pound;25 per night, in addition,
for two useless coadjutors. I replied, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
having duly deliberated on his suggestion, and
considered the terms of our last compact, I saw
no possible means of placing the new one in a
more alluring shape, except by offering him the
entire produce of the engagement. After I had
dispatched my letter, I repented bitterly, and
was terrified lest he should think me serious,
and hold me to the bargain; but he deigned no
answer, and this time I escaped for the fright
I had given myself. When in London, I called
to see him, and met with a cordial reception;
but he soon alluded to the late correspondence,
and half seriously said, "That was a curious
letter you wrote to me, and the joke with which
you concluded it, by no means a good one."
"Oh," said I, laughing, "it would have been
much worse if you had taken me at my word."
He then laughed, too, and we parted excellent
friends. I never saw him again. He returned
to the Continent, and died, having purchased
the title of Baron, with a patent of nobility,
from some foreign potentate, which, with his
accumulated earnings, somewhat dilapidated by
gambling, he bequeathed to his only son. Paganini
was the founder of his school, and the original
inventor of those extraordinary <i>tours de
force</i> with which all his successors and imitators
are accustomed to astonish the uninitiated.
But he still stands at the head of the list, although
eminent names are included in it, and
is not likely to be pushed from his pedestal.</p>

<p>Hearde mother say to Barbara, "Be sure
the sirloin is well basted for y<sup>e</sup> king's physician:"
which avised me that Dr. Linacre was
expected. In truth, he returned with father in
y<sup>e</sup> barge; and they tooke a turn on y<sup>e</sup> river
bank before sitting down to table; I noted them
from my lattice; and anon, father, beckoning
me, cries, "Child, bring out my favorite Treatyse
on Fisshynge, printed by Wynkyn de Worde;
I must give the doctor my loved passage."</p>

<p>Joyning 'em with y<sup>e</sup> book, I found father telling
him of y<sup>e</sup> roach, dace, chub, barbel, etc., we
oft catch opposite y<sup>e</sup> church; and hastilie turning
over y<sup>e</sup> leaves, he beginneth with unction
to read y<sup>e</sup> passage ensuing, which I love to y<sup>e</sup>
full as much as he:&mdash;</p>

<p>He observeth, if the angler's sport shoulde
fail him, "he at y<sup>e</sup> best hathe his holsom walk
and mery at his ease, a swete ayre of the swete
savour of y<sup>e</sup> meade of flowers, that maketh him
hungry; he heareth the melodious harmonie of
fowles, he seeth y<sup>e</sup> young swans herons, ducks,
cotes, and manie other fowles, with theire
broods, which me seemeth better than alle y<sup>e</sup>
noise of hounds, faukenors, and fowlers can
make. And if the angler take fysshe, then there
is noe man merrier than he is in his spryte."
And, "Ye shall not use this forsaid crafty disporte
for no covetysnesse in the encreasing and
sparing of your money onlie, but pryncipallie for
your solace, and to cause the health of your
bodie, and speciallie of your soule, for when ye
purpose to goe on your disportes of fysshynge,
ye will not desire greatlie manie persons with
you, which woulde lett you of your game. And
thenne ye may serve God devoutlie, in saying
affectuouslie your customable prayer; and
thus doing, ye shall eschew and voyd manie
vices."</p>

<p>"Angling is itselfe a vice," cries Erasmus
from y<sup>e</sup> thresholde; "for my part I will fish
none, save and except for pickled oysters."</p>

<p>"In the regions below," answers father; and
then laughinglie tells Linacre of his firste dialogue
with Erasmus, who had beene feasting in
my Lord Mayor's cellar:&mdash;"'Whence come you?'
'From below.' 'What were they about there?'
'Eating live oysters, and drinking out of leather
jacks.' 'Either you are Erasmus,' etc.
'Either you are More or nothing.'"</p>

<p>"'Neither more nor less,' you should have
rejoyned," sayth the doctor.</p>

<p>"How I wish I had," says father; "don't
torment me with a jest I might have made and
did not make; 'speciallie to put downe Erasmus."</p>

<p>"Concedo nulli," sayth Erasmus.</p>

<p>"Why are you so lazy?" asks Linacre; "I
am sure you can speak English if you will."</p>

<p>"Soe far from it," sayth Erasmus, "that I
made my incapacitie an excuse for declining an
English rectory. Albeit, you know how Wareham
requited me; saying, in his kind, generous
way, I served the Church more by my pen than
I coulde by preaching sermons in a countrie
village."</p>

<p>Sayth Linacre, "The archbishop hath made
another remark, as much to y<sup>e</sup> purpose: to wit,
that he has received from you the immortalitie
which emperors and kings cannot bestow."</p>

<p>"They cannot even bid a smoking sirloin retain
its heat an hour after it hath left the fire,"
sayth father. "Tilly-vally! as my good Alice
says,&mdash;let us remember the universal doom,
'fruges consumere nati,' and philosophize over
our ale and bracket."</p>

<p>"Not Cambridge ale, neither," sayth Erasmus.</p>

<p>"Will you never forget that unlucky beverage?"
sayth father. "Why, man, think how
manie poore scholars there be, that content themselves,
as I have hearde one of St. John's declare,
with a penny piece of beef amongst four,
stewed into pottage with a little salt and oatmeal;
and that after fasting from four o'clock
in the morning! Say grace for us this daye,
Erasmus, with goode heart."</p>

<p>At table, discourse flowed soe thicke and faste
that I mighte aim in vayn to chronicle it&mdash;and
why should I? dwelling as I doe at y<sup>e</sup> fountayn
head? Onlie that I find pleasure, alreadie, in
glancing over the foregoing pages whensoever
they concern father and Erasmus, and wish they
were more faithfullie recalled and better writ.
One thing sticks by me,&mdash;a funny reply of father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to a man who owed him money and who
put him off with "Memento Morieris." "I bid
you," retorted father, "Memento Mori &AElig;ris,
and I wish you woulde take as goode care to
provide for y<sup>e</sup> one as I do for the other."</p>

<p>Linacre laughed much at this, and sayd,&mdash;"That
was real wit; a spark struck at the
moment; and with noe ill-nature in it, for I am
sure your debtor coulde not help laughing."</p>

<p>"Not he," quoth Erasmus. "More's drollerie
is like that of a young gentlewoman of his
name, which shines without burning." ...
and, oddlie enow, he looked acrosse at <i>me</i>. I
am sure he meant Bess.</p>

<p>Father broughte home a strange gueste to-daye,&mdash;a
converted Jew, with grizzlie beard,
furred gown, and eyes that shone like lamps lit
in dark cavernes. He had beene to Benmarine
and Treme&ccedil;en, to y<sup>e</sup> Holie Citie and to Damascus,
to Urmia and Assyria, and I think alle over
y<sup>e</sup> knowne world; and tolde us manie strange
tales, one hardlie knew how to believe; as, for
example, of a sea-coast tribe, called y<sup>e</sup> Balouches,
who live on fish and build theire dwellings
of the bones. Alsoe, of a race of his countrie-men
beyond Euphrates who believe in Christ,
but know nothing of y<sup>e</sup> Pope; and of whom
were y<sup>e</sup> Magians y<sup>t</sup> followed y<sup>e</sup> Star. This
agreeth not with our legend. He averred that,
though soe far apart from theire brethren, theire
speech was y<sup>e</sup> same, and even theire songs; and
he sang or chaunted one which he sayd was
common among y<sup>e</sup> Jews alle over y<sup>e</sup> world, and
had beene so ever since theire citie was ruinated
and y<sup>e</sup> people captivated, and yet it was
never sett down by note. Erasmus, who knows
little or nought of Hebrew, listened to y<sup>e</sup> words
with curiositie, and made him repeate them
twice or thrice: and though I know not y<sup>e</sup> character,
it seemed to me they sounded thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Adir Hu yivne bethcha beccaro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">El, b'ne; El, b'ne; El, b'ne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bethcha beccaro.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though Christianish, he woulde not eat pig's
face; and sayd swine's flesh was forbidden by
y<sup>e</sup> Hebrew law for its unwholesomenesse in hot
countries and hot weather, rather than by way
of arbitrarie prohibition. Daisy took a great dislike
to this man, and woulde not sit next him.</p>

<p>In the hay-field alle y<sup>e</sup> evening. Swathed
father in a hay-rope, and made him pay y<sup>e</sup> fine,
which he pretended to resist. Cecy was just
about to cast one round Erasmus, when her
heart failed and she ran away, colouring to y<sup>e</sup>
eyes. He sayd, he never saw such pretty shame.
Father reclining on y<sup>e</sup> hay, with head on my
lap and his eyes shut, Bess asked if he were
asleep. He made answer, "Yes, and dreaming."
I askt, "Of what?" "Of a far-off future
daye, Meg; when thou and I shall looke
back on this hour, and this hay-field, and my
head on thy lap."</p>

<p>"Nay, but what a stupid dream, Mr. More,"
says mother. "Why, what woulde <i>you</i> dreame
of, Mrs. Alice?" "Forsooth, if I dreamed at
alle, when I was wide awake, it shoulde be of
being Lord Chancellor at y<sup>e</sup> leaste." "Well,
wife, I forgive thee for not saying at the <i>most</i>.
Lord Chancellor quotha! And you woulde be
Dame Alice, I trow, and ride in a whirlecote,
and keep a Spanish jennet, and a couple of grey
hounds, and wear a train before and behind,
and carry a jerfalcon on your fist." "On my
wrist." "No, that's not such a pretty word as
t'other! Go to, go!"</p>

<p>Straying from y<sup>e</sup> others, to a remote corner
of the meadow, or ever I was aware, I came
close upon Gammer Gurney, holding somewhat
with much care. "Give ye good den, Mistress
Meg," quoth she, "I cannot abear to rob y<sup>e</sup>
birds of theire nests; but I knows you and
yours be kind to dumb creatures, soe here's a
nest o' young owzels for ye&mdash;and I can't call
'em dumb nowther, for they'll sing bravelie
some o' these days." "How hast fared, of late,
Gammer?" quoth I. "Why, well enow for
such as I," she made answer; "since I lost y<sup>e</sup>
use o' my right hand, I can nowther spin, nor
nurse sick folk, but I pulls rushes, and that
brings me a few pence, and I be a good herbalist;
and, because I says one or two English
prayers and hates y<sup>e</sup> priests, some folks thinks
me a witch." "But why dost hate y<sup>e</sup> priests?"
quoth I. "Never you mind," she gave answer,
"I've reasons manie; and for my English prayers,
they were taught me by a gentleman I
nursed, that's now a saint in heaven, along
with poor Joan."</p>

<p>And soe she hobbled off, and I felt kindlie
towards her, I scarce knew why&mdash;perhaps because
she spake soe lovingly of her dead sister,
and because of that sister's name. <i>My</i> mother's
name was Joan.</p>

<hr />

<p>Erasmus is gone. His last saying to father
was, "They will have you at court yet;" and
father's answer, "When Plato's year comes
round."</p>

<p>To me he gave a copy, how precious! of his
Testament. "You are an elegant Latinist,
Margaret," he was pleased to say, "but, if you
woulde drink deeplie of y<sup>e</sup> well-springs of wisdom,
applie to Greek. The Latins have onlie
shallow rivulets; the Greeks, copious rivers,
running over sands of gold. Read Plato; he
wrote on marble, with a diamond; but above
alle, read y<sup>e</sup> New Testament. 'Tis the key to
the kingdom of heaven."</p>

<p>To Mr. Gunnel, he said, smiling, "Have a
care of thyself, dear Gonellus, and take a little
wine for thy stomach's sake. The wages of
most scholars nowadays, are weak eyes, ill-health,
an empty purse, and shorte commons.
I neede only bid thee beware of the two first."</p>

<p>To Bess, "Farewell, Bessy; thank you for
mending my bad Latin. When I write to you,
I will be sure to signe myselfe 'Roterodamius.'
Farewell, sweete, Cecil; let me always continue
your 'desired amiable.' And you, Jacky,&mdash;love
your book a little more."</p>

<p>"Jack's deare mother, not content with her
girls," sayth father, "was alwaies wishing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
a boy, and at last she had one that means to
remain a boy alle his life."</p>

<p>"The Dutch schoolmasters thoughte <i>me</i> dulle
and heavie," sayth Erasmus, "soe there is
some hope of Jacky yet." And soe, stepped
into y<sup>e</sup> barge, which we watched to Chelsea
Reach. How dulle the house has beene ever
since! Rupert and William have had me into
y<sup>e</sup> pavillion to hear y<sup>e</sup> plot of a miracle-play
they have alreadie begunne to talk over for
Christmasse, but it seemed to me downrighte
rubbish. Father sleeps in towne to-nighte, soe
we shall be stupid enow. Bessy hath undertaken
to work father a slipper for his tender
foot; and is happie, tracing for y<sup>e</sup> pattern our
three moor-cocks and colts; but I am idle and
tiresome.</p>

<p>If I had paper, I woulde beginne my projected
<i>opus</i>; but I dare not ask Gunnel for anie
more just yet; nor have anie money to buy
some. I wish I had a couple of angels. I think
I shall write to father for them to-morrow; he
alwaies likes to heare from us if he is twenty-four
hours absent, providing we conclude not
with "I have nothing more to say."</p>

<hr />

<p>I have writ my letter to father. I almoste
wish, now, that I had not sent it.</p>

<p>Rupert and Will still full of theire moralitie,
which reallie has some fun in it. To ridicule
y<sup>e</sup> extravagance of those who, as the saying is,
carry theire farms and fields on theire backs,
William proposes to come in, all verdant, with
a reall model of a farm on his back and a windmill
on his head.</p>

<hr />

<p>How sweete, how gracious an answer from
father! John Harris has broughte me with it
y<sup>e</sup> two angels; less prized than this epistle.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right">July 10.</p>

<p>Sixteenth birthdaye. Father away, which
made it sadde. Mother gave me a payr of blue
hosen with silk clocks; Mr. Gunnel, an ivorie
handled stylus; Bess, a bodkin for my hair;
Daisy, a book-mark; Mercy, a saffron cake;
Jack, a basket; and Cecil, a nosegay. William's
present was fayrest of alle, but I am hurte
with him and myselfe: for he offered it soe
queerlie and tagged it with such.... I refused
it, and there's an end. 'Twas unmannerlie and
unkinde of me, and I've cried aboute it since.</p>

<p>Father alwaies gives us a birthdaye treat;
soe, contrived that mother shoulde take us to
see my Lord Cardinal of York goe to Westminster
in state. We had a merrie water-party;
got goode places and saw the show; crosse-bearers,
pillar-bearers, ushers and alle. Himselfe
in crimson engrayned sattin, and tippet of
sables, with an orange in his hand helde to 's
nose, as though y<sup>e</sup> common ayr were too vile to
breathe. What a pompous priest it is! The
archbishop mighte well say, "That man is
drunk with too much prosperitie."</p>

<p>Between dinner and supper, we had a fine
skirmish in y<sup>e</sup> straits of Thermopyl&aelig;. Mr. Gunnel
headed the Persians, and Will was Leonidas,
with a swashing buckler, and a helmet a
yard high; but Mr. Gunnel gave him such a
rap on the crest that it went over y<sup>e</sup> wall; soe
then William thought there was nothing left for
him but to die. Howbeit, as he had beene layd
low sooner than he had reckoned on, he prolonged
his last agonies a goode deal, and gave
one of y<sup>e</sup> Persians a tremendous kick just as
they were aboute to rifle his pouch. They therefore
thoughte there must be somewhat in it they
shoulde like to see; soe, helde him down in
spite of his hitting righte and lefte, and pulled
therefrom, among sundrie lesser matters, a carnation
knot of mine. Poor varlet, I wish he
would not be so stupid....</p>

<p>After supper, mother proposed a concert; and
we were alle singing a rounde, when, looking
up, I saw father standing in y<sup>e</sup> door-way, with
such a happy smile on his face! He was close
behind Rupert and Daisy, who were singing
from y<sup>e</sup> same book, and advertised them of his
coming by gentlie knocking theire heads together;
but I had the firste kiss, even before
mother, because of my birthdaye.</p>

<hr />

<p>It turns out that father's lateness yester-even
was caused by press of businesse; a forayn
mission having beene proposed to him, which
he resisted as long as he could, but was at
lengthe reluctantlie induced to accept. Length
of his stay uncertayn, which casts a gloom on
alle; but there is soe much to doe as to leave
little time to think, and father is busiest of alle;
yet hath founde leisure to concert with mother
for us a journey into y<sup>e</sup> country, which will
occupy some of y<sup>e</sup> weeks of his absence. I am
full of carefulle thoughts and forebodings, being
naturallie of too anxious a disposition. Oh, let
me caste alle my cares on another! Fecisti
nos ad te, Domine; et inquietum est cor nostrum,
donec requiescat in te.</p>

<hr />

<p>'Tis soe manie months agone since that I
made an entry in my libellus, as that my
motto&mdash;"nulla dies sine linea&mdash;," hath somewhat
of sarcasm in it. How manie things doe
I beginne and leave unfinisht! and yet, less from
caprice than lack of strength; like him of whom
y<sup>e</sup> scripture was writ&mdash;"this man beganne to
build and was not able to finish." My <i>opus</i>,
for instance; the which my father's prolonged
absence in y<sup>e</sup> autumn and my winter visitt to
aunt Nan and aunt Fan gave me such leisure to
carrie forward. But alack! leisure was less to
seeke than learninge; and when I came back to
mine olde taskes, leisure was awanting too;
and then, by reason of my sleeping in a separate
chamber, I was enabled to steale hours from y<sup>e</sup>
earlie morn and hours from y<sup>e</sup> night, and, like
unto Solomon's virtuous woman, my candle
went not out. But 'twas not to purpose y<sup>t</sup> I
worked, like y<sup>e</sup> virtuous woman, for I was following
a Jack-o-lantern; having forsooke y<sup>e</sup>
straight path laid downe by Erasmus for a
foolish path of mine owne; and soe I toyled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and blundered, and puzzled, and was mazed;
and then came on that payn in my head.
Father sayd, "What makes Meg soe pale!"
and I sayd not: and, at y<sup>e</sup> last, I tolde mother
there was somewhat throbbing and twisting in
y<sup>e</sup> back of mine head like unto a little worm
that woulde not die; and she made answer,
"Ah, a maggot," and soe by her scoff I was
shamed. Then I gave over mine opus, but y<sup>e</sup>
payn did not yet goe; soe then I was longing
for y<sup>e</sup> deare pleasure, and fondlie turning over y<sup>e</sup>
leaves, and wondering woulde father be surprised
and pleased with it some daye, when father
himself came in or ever I was aware. He
sayth, "What hast thou, Meg?" I faltered and
would sett it aside. He sayth, "Nay, let me
see;" and soe takes it from me; and after y<sup>e</sup>
firste glance throws himself into a seat, his back
to me, and firste runs it hastilie through, then
beginnes with methode and such silence and
gravitie as that I trembled at his side, and felt
what it must be to stand a prisoner at the bar,
and he y<sup>e</sup> judge. Sometimes I thought he must
be pleased, at others not: at lengthe, alle my
fond hopes were ended by his crying, "This will
never doe. Poor wretch, hath this then beene
thy toyl? How couldst find time for soe much
labor? for here hath been trouble enow and to
spare. Thou must have stolen it, sweet Meg,
from the night, and prevented y<sup>e</sup> morning watch.
Most dear'st! thy father's owne loved child;"
and soe, caressing me till I gave over my shame
and disappointment.</p>

<p>"I neede not to tell thee, Meg," father sayth,
"of y<sup>e</sup> unprofitable labour of Sisyphus, nor of
drawing water in a sieve. There are some
things, most deare one, that a woman, if she
trieth, may doe as well as a man; and some
she can not, and some she had better not.
Now, I tell thee firmlie, since y<sup>e</sup> first payn is y<sup>e</sup>
leaste sharpe, that, despite y<sup>e</sup> spiritt and genius
herein shewn, I am avised 'tis work thou canst
not and work thou hadst better not doe. But
judge for thyselfe; if thou wilt persist, thou
shalt have leisure and quiet, and a chamber in
my new building, and alle y<sup>e</sup> help my gallery of
books may afford. But thy father says, forbear."</p>

<p>Soe, what could I say, but "My father shall
never speak to me in vayn!"</p>

<p>Then he gathered y<sup>e</sup> papers up and sayd,
"Then I shall take temptation out of your
way;" and pressing 'em to his heart as he did
soe, sayth, "They are as deare to me as they
can be to you;" and soe left me, looking out as
though I noted (but I noted not), the clear-shining
Thames. 'Twas twilighte, and I stoode
there I know not how long, alone and lonely;
with tears coming, I knew not why, into mine
eyes. There was a weight in y<sup>e</sup> ayr, as of
coming thunder; the screaming, ever and anon,
of Juno and Argus, inclined me to mellancholie,
as it alwaies does: and at length I beganne to
note y<sup>e</sup> moon rising, and y<sup>e</sup> deepening clearnesse
of y<sup>e</sup> water, and y<sup>e</sup> lazy motion of y<sup>e</sup> barges,
and y<sup>e</sup> flashes of light whene'er y<sup>e</sup> rowers dipt
theire oars. And then I beganne to attend to
y<sup>e</sup> cries and different sounds from acrosse y<sup>e</sup>
water, and y<sup>e</sup> tolling of a distant bell; and I
felle back on mine olde heart-sighinge, "Fecisti
nos ad te, Domine; et inquietum est cor nostrum,
donec requiescat in te."</p>

<p>Or ever the week was gone, my father had
contrived for me another journey to New Hall,
to abide with the lay nuns, as he calleth them,
aunt Nan and aunt Fan, whom my step-mother
loveth not, but whom I love and whom father
loveth. Indeede, 'tis sayd in Essex that at
first he inclined to aunt Nan rather than to my
mother; but that, perceiving my mother affected
his companie and aunt Nan affected it not, he
diverted his hesitating affections unto her and
took her to wife. Albeit, aunt Nan loveth him
dearlie as a sister ought: indeed, she loveth
alle, except, methinketh, herself, to whom,
alone, she is rigid and severe. How holie are
my aunts' lives! Cloistered nuns could not be
more pure, and could scarce be as usefulle.
Though wise, they can be gay; though noe
longer young, they love the young. And theire
reward is, the young love them; and I am fulle
sure, in this world they seeke noe better.</p>

<p>Returned to Chelsea, I spake much in prayse
of mine aunts, and of single life. On a certayn
evening, we maids were sett at our needles and
samplers on y<sup>e</sup> pavillion steps; and, as follie
will out, 'gan talk of what we would fayn have
to our lots, shoulde a good fairie starte up and
grant eache a wish. Daisy was for a countess's
degree, with hawks and hounds. Bess was for
founding a college, Mercy a hospital, and she
spake soe experimentallie of its conditions that
I was fayn to goe partners with her in the same.
Cecy commenced "Supposing I were married;
if once that I were married"&mdash;on which, father,
who had come up unperceived, burst out laughing
and sayth, "Well, dame Cecily, and what
state would you keep?" Howbeit as he and I
afterwards paced together, juxta fluvium, he did
say, "Mercy hath well propounded the conditions
of an hospital or alms-house for aged and sick
folk, and 'tis a fantasie of mine to sett even
such an one afoot, and give you the conduct of
the same."</p>

<p>From this careless speech, dropped, as 'twere,
by y<sup>e</sup> way, hath sprung mine house of refuge!
and oh, what pleasure have I derived from it!
How good is my father! how the poor bless
him! and how kind is he, through them, to me!
Laying his hand kindly on my shoulder, this
morning, he sayd, "Meg, how fares it with thee
now? Have I cured the payn in thy head?"
Then, putting the house-key into mine hand, he
laughingly added, "'Tis now yours, my joy, by
Livery and Seisin."</p>

<hr />

<p class="right">Aug. 6.</p>

<p>I wish William w<sup>d</sup> give me back my Testament.
Tis one thing to steal a knot or a posie,
and another to borrow y<sup>e</sup> most valuable book in
y<sup>e</sup> house and keep it week after week. He
soughte it with a kind of mysterie, soe as that
I forbeare to ask it of him in companie, lest I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
s<sup>d</sup> doe him an ill turn; and yet I have none
other occasion.</p>

<p>The emperor, the King of France, and Cardinal
Ximenes are alle striving which shall have
Erasmus, and alle in vayn. He hath refused a
professor's chayr at Louvain, and a Sicilian
bishoprick. E'en thus it was with him when
he was here this spring&mdash;the Queen w<sup>d</sup> have
had him for her preceptor, the King and Cardinal
prest on him a royall apartment and salarie,
Oxford and Cambridge contended for him, but
his saying was, "Alle these I value less than
my libertie, my studdies, and my literarie toyls."
How much greater is he than those who woulde
confer on him greatness! Noe man of letters
hath equall reputation or is soe much courted.</p>

<hr />

<p>Yestereven, after overlooking the men playing
at loggats, father and I strayed away along
Thermopyl&aelig; into y<sup>e</sup> home-field; and as we
sauntered together under the elms, he sayth
with a sigh, "Jack, is Jack, and no More ...
he will never be any thing. An' 'twere not for
my beloved wenches, I should be an unhappy
father. But what though!&mdash;My Meg is better
unto me than ten sons; and it maketh no difference
at harvest time whether our corn were put
into the ground by a man or a woman."</p>

<p>While I was turning in my mind what excuse
I might make for John, father taketh me at unawares
by a sudden change of subject; saying,
"Come, tell me, Meg, why canst not affect
Will Roper?"</p>

<p>I was a good while silent, at length made
answer, "He is so unlike alle I esteem and admire ... so
unlike alle I have been taught to
esteem and admire by you."&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have at you," he returned laughing, "I
knew not I had been sharpening weapons
agaynst myself. True he is neither Achilles nor
Hector, nor even Paris, but yet well enough,
meseems, as times go&mdash;smarter and comelier
than either Heron or Dancey."</p>

<p>I, faltering, made answer, "Good looks affect
me but little&mdash;'tis in his better part I feel the
want. He can not ... discourse, for instance,
to one's mind and soul, like unto you, dear
father, or Erasmus."</p>

<p>"I should marvel if he could," returned father
gravelie, "thou art mad, my daughter, to look,
in a youth of Will's years, for the mind of a
man of forty or fifty. What were Erasmus and
I, dost thou suppose, at Will's age? Alas,
Meg, I should not like you to know what I was!
Men called me the boy-sage, and I know not
what, but in my heart and head was a world of
sin and folly. Thou mightst as well expect
Will to have my hair, eyes, and teeth, alle
getting y<sup>e</sup> worse for wear, as to have the fruits
of my life-long experience, in some cases full
dearly bought. Take him for what he is, match
him by the young minds of his owne standing:
consider how long and closelie we have known
him. His parts are, surelie, not amiss: he hath
more book-lore than Dancey, more mother wit
than Allington."</p>

<p>"But why need I to concern myself about
him?" I exclaymed, "Will is very well in his
way: why s<sup>d</sup> we cross each other's paths? I
am young, I have much to learn, I love my
studdies&mdash;why interrupt them with other and
lesse wise thoughts?"</p>

<p>"Because nothing can be wise that is not
practical," returned father, "and I teach my
children philosophie to fitt them for living in y<sup>e</sup>
world, not above it. One may spend a life in
dreaming over Plato, and yet goe out of it without
leaving y<sup>e</sup> world a whit y<sup>e</sup> better for our
having made part of it. 'Tis to little purpose
we studdy, if it onlie makes us look for perfections
in others which they may in vayn seek for
in ourselves. It is not even necessary or goode
for us to live entirelie with congeniall spiritts.
The vigourous tempers the inert, the passionate
is evened by the cool-tempered, the prosaic
balances the visionarie. Woulde thy mother
suit me better, dost thou suppose, if she coulde
discuss polemicks like Luther or Melancthon?
E'en thine owne sweet mother, Meg, was less
affected to study than thou art&mdash;she learnt to
love it for my sake, but I made her what she
was."</p>

<p>And, with a suddain burste of fond recollection,
he hid his eyes on my shoulder, and for a
moment or soe, cried bitterlie. As for me, I
shed, oh! such salt teares!...</p>

<h2>THE PEARL-DIVERS.</h2>


<p>At the commencement of the last year's fishery,
there was a man whom, go wherever
I would, I was always certain to meet. Like
myself, he was a diver, and like myself moreover,
he pretended to have no surname, but went
simply by the name of Rafael. At the cleansing-trough,
beneath the surface of the sea, no
matter where it was, we were always thrown
together, so that we quickly became intimate;
and his remarkable skill as a diver had inspired
me with considerable esteem for him. Alike
courageous as skillful, he snapped his fingers at
the sharks, declaring his power to intimidate
them by a particular expression of the eye. In
fine, he was a fearless diver, an industrious
workman, and, above all, a most jovial comrade.</p>

<p>Matters went smoothly enough between us,
till the day when a girl and her mother took up
their abode at the island Espiritu Sante.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Some business that I had to transact with the
dealers in this island afforded me an opportunity
of seeing her. I fell desperately in love; and
as I enjoyed a certain amount of reputation,
neither she nor her mother looked with an unfavorable
eye on my suit or my presents. When
the day's work was over, and every body supposed
me asleep in my hut, I swam across to
the island, whence I returned about an hour
after midnight without my absence being at all
surmised.</p>

<p>Some days had elapsed since my first nocturnal
visit to Espiritu Sante, when, as I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
one morning going to the fishery just before
daybreak, I met one of those old crones who
pretend to be able to charm the sharks by their
spells. She was seated near my hut, and appeared
to be watching my arrival. As she perceived
me, she exclaimed, "How fares it with
my son, Jos&eacute; Juan?"</p>

<p>"Good morning, mother!" I replied, and was
passing on, when she approached me, and said,
"Listen to me, Jos&eacute; Juan; I have to speak to
you of that which nearly concerns you."</p>

<p>"Nearly concerns me!" I repeated, in great
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you deny that your heart is in
the island of Espiritu Sante, or that you cross
the strait every night to see and converse with
her on whom you have bestowed your love?"</p>

<p>"How know you that?"</p>

<p>"No matter; I know it well. Jos&eacute; Juan,
for you this voyage is fraught with a twofold
peril. The foes whom my charms can hold
harmless during the day only lie in wait for you
each night beneath the waves; on the shore,
foes more dangerous still, and over whom my
arts are powerless, dog your steps. I come to
offer you my aid to combat these double dangers."</p>

<p>My only answer was by a loud laugh of contempt.
The old Indian's eyes sparkled with
fiendish fury as she exclaimed, "And because
you are without faith, you deem me without
power? Be it so; there are those who believe
in the influence you but scoff at."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she drew from her pocket a little
case of printed cloth, and producing amid pearls
of inferior value one of a large size and brilliant
water, she replied, "Know you aught of this?"
It was one I had given to Jesusita; for such
was the girl's name.</p>

<p>"How came you by it?" cried I.</p>

<p>The witch gave me a look of hatred.</p>

<p>"How came I by it? Why, 'twas given me
by a damsel the fairest that ever set foot on
these shores; a damsel who would be the glory
and happiness of a young man, and who came
to crave my protection&mdash;that protection you
hold so cheap&mdash;for one she fondly loves."</p>

<p>"His name!" I exclaimed, with a fearful
sinking at my heart.</p>

<p>"What matters it," jeeringly returned the
hag, "since <i>his</i> name is not the one you bear?"</p>

<p>I hardly know how I resisted the impulse to
crush the cursed witch beneath my feet; but
after a moment's reflection, I turned my back
to her that she might not read in my face the
anguish of my soul, and coolly saying, "You are
a lying old dotard," I walked on to the fishery.</p>

<p>On the evening of that day, which seemed as
if it would never close, I went as usual to
Jesusita, and the welcome she gave me soon
dispelled all lurking suspicions. I felt no doubt
but that the old woman, in resentment of my
contemptuous treatment, had purposely deceived
me as to the name of him for whom Jesusita had
craved that protection which I had despised.</p>

<p>I had utterly forgotten my scene with the
witch, when, one night, I was as usual crossing
the strait on my return home. The sky was
dark and lowering, yet not so cloudy but that I
could distinguish amid the waves something
which, from its manner of swimming, I could
make out to be a man. The object was alongside
of me. The old crone's words rushed upon
my memory, and I felt a thrill of agony convulse
my frame. For an enemy I cared but little; the
idea that I had a rival unnerved me at once.</p>

<p>I determined to ascertain who the unknown
might be; and not wishing to be seen, I swam
under water in his direction. When, according
to my calculation, we must have crossed each
other, he above and I below the surface, I rose
above water. The blood had rushed to my head
with such violence as to render me unable for
some time to distinguish aught amidst the darkness
beyond the phosphorescent light that played
upon the crest of the waves; unerring signs
of a coming storm. Nevertheless, I held on my
course in the direction of Espiritu Sante. Some
few minutes elapsed ere I again beheld the
swimmer's head. He clove the waves with such
rapidity that I could scarce keep pace with him.
But one alone among all I knew could vie with
me in swiftness; I redoubled my efforts, and
soon gained so much on him as obliged me to
strike out less quickly. In short, I saw him land
upon a rock and ascend it; and as a flash of
lightning played upon sea and shore, I recognized
the face of Rafael. Here, as elsewhere, were
we doomed to cross each other's path. A feeling
of hatred, deadly and intense, was busy at
my heart, and methought it were well we met
but once again. However, we were destined to
meet on one more occasion than I had reckoned
upon.</p>

<p>At first I determined upon calling him by
name and discovering my presence; but there
are moments in one's life when our actions refuse
to second the will. Spite of myself, I suffered
him to pursue his way, while I gained the eminence
he had just quitted. Thence was it easy
for me to watch his course. I observed him
take the same direction I was so wont to take,
then knock at the door of that hut I knew so
well. He entered, and disappeared.</p>

<p>I fancied for one moment I heard, borne along
the howling of the gale, the old witch's scoffing
laugh as she croaked out, "What matters it to
you, since <i>his</i> name is not the one you bear?"
and, looming amid the darkness, methought I
saw her shriveled and withered arm stretched
out in the direction of Jesusita's dwelling; and
I rushed forward, knife in hand. A few strides,
and I stood before the door, and stooped down
to listen; but I heard naught beyond indistinct
murmurings. I had now partially recovered my
<i>sang-froid</i>, and bent my whole thoughts upon
revenge.</p>

<p>I drew my knife, and passed it along a stone
to assure its edge; but I did so with such carelessness
or agitation that it shivered to the hilt.
Thus deprived of the sole weapon that I could
rely upon for my revenge, I felt that I had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
an instant to lose. I ran in all haste to the
beach, and unmoored a boat that lay alongside.
My rage renewed my energies: I crossed the
strait, rushed to my hut, procured another knife,
and again set out to Espiritu Sante. The gale
increased in violence. The sea gleamed like a
fiery lake. The gavista's<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> wailing cry re-echoed
along the rocks; the sea-wolf's howl was heard
amid the darkness. All at once sounds of
another kind broke upon my ear: they seemed
to proceed from the very bosom of the ocean. I
listened; but a sudden squall overpowered the
confused murmurings of the waves, and I fancied
my senses had deceived me, when, some seconds
afterward, the cry was repeated. This time I
was not mistaken: the cry I heard was that of
a human being in the very extremity of anguish
and despair. As the voice proceeded from the
direction of the island, I at once conjectured it
was Rafael who was calling for help. I looked
out, but looked in vain; the obscurity was too
thick, and I could distinguish nothing. Suddenly,
I again heard the voice exclaim, "Boat
ahoy, for God's blessed sake!"</p>

<p>It was Rafael's voice. 'Tis all very well to
have sworn to do your enemy to death, to wreak
your just revenge on him who has so bitterly
aggrieved you; yet when, on a night murky and
dark as that his tones arise from forth a sea
swarming with monsters, and when those tones
are uttered by a fearless man, and, albeit,
wrestling in mortal peril, there is in that cry of
last anguish somewhat that strikes awe to the
very soul. I could not repress a shudder.</p>

<p>But my emotion was of short duration. I
heard the sounds of a strong arm buffeting the
waves, and I rowed in that direction. Amidst
a luminous shower of spray and foam I discovered
Rafael. Singular enough, instead of availing
himself of his strength to gain the boat, he remained
stationary. I quickly perceived the
cause. At some distance from him, a little
below the surface of the water, there was a
strong phosphoric light; this light was slowly
making way toward Rafael. Right well I knew
what that light portended; it streamed from a
<i>tintorera</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of the largest size. One stroke of
the oar, and I was close to Rafael: he uttered a
cry as he perceived me, but was too much exhausted
to speak. He seized the gunwale of
the boat by an effort of despair, but his arms
were too wearied to enable him to raise his body.
His eyes, though glazed with fear, yet bore so
expressive a glance as they encountered mine,
that I seized his hands in my own, and pressed
them forcibly against the sides of the boat. The
<i>tintorera</i> still gradually advanced. For a moment,
but one brief moment, Rafael's legs hung
motionless; he uttered a piercing shriek, his
eyes closed, his hands let loose their hold, and
the upper part of his body fell back into the sea.
The shark had bitten him in two.</p>

<p>Ay! I might, perchance, have grasped his
limbs too firmly in mine, possibly I prevented
him from getting into the boat, but my knife
was innocent of his blood; besides, was he not
my rival&mdash;perchance my successful rival? However,
scarcely had he disappeared than I plunged
after him; for although the <i>tintorera</i> had ridded
me of a hated foe, still I bore it a grudge for its
brutal proceedings in thus summarily disposing
of poor Rafael. Besides, the honor of the corporation
of divers was at stake. Having once
tasted human flesh, the shark would doubtless
attack us in turn. Well, nothing so much excites
the ferocity of the <i>tintorera</i> as such tempestuous
nights as the one that bore its silent
testimony to my rival's fate. A viscous substance
that oozes from porous holes around the
monster's mouth diffuses itself over the surface
of the skin, rendering them as luminous as fire-flies,
and this particularly during a thunderstorm.
This luminous appearance is the more
visible in proportion to the darkness of the night.
By a merciful dispensation of nature, they are
almost unable to see; so that the silent swimmer
has at least one advantage over them. Moreover,
they can not seize their prey without turning
on their backs; so that it is not difficult to
imagine that a courageous man and a skillful
swimmer has some chances in his favor.</p>

<p>I dived to no great depth, in order to husband
my wind, and also to cast a hasty glance above,
beneath, and around me. The waves roared
above my head, loud as a crash of thunder;
fiery flakes of water drove around like dust before
the winds of March; but in my immediate
vicinity all was calm. A black and shapeless
mass struck against me as I lay suspended in
my billowy recess; 'twas all that was left of
Rafael. Surely it was written in the book of
doom that I should always find that man in
my path.</p>

<p>I surmised that the brute I was in quest of
would be at no great distance, for the fiery
streak I had perceived waxed larger and larger.
The <i>tintorera</i> and myself must, I inferred, be at
equal depths; but the shark was preparing to
rise. My breath began to fail, and I was unwilling
to allow the monster to get above me,
as then he could have made me share Rafael's
fate without troubling himself to turn on his
back. My hopes of obtaining the victory over
it depended upon the time it required to execute
this man&oelig;uvre. The <i>tintorera</i> swam diagonally
toward me with such rapidity that at one time
I was near enough to distinguish the membrane
that half-covered its eyes, and to feel its dusky
fins graze my body. Gobbets of human flesh
still clung around the lower jaw. The monster
gazed on me with its dim, glassy eye. My
head had that moment attained the level of
its own. I drank in the air with a gurgle I
could not suppress, and struck out a lusty
stroke in a parallel direction and turned round:
well for me I did so. The moon lighted up for
a single instant the whitish-gray colored belly
of the <i>tintorera</i>&mdash;that instant was enough for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
as it opened its enormous mouth, bristling with
its double row of long pointed teeth, I plunged
the dagger I had reserved for Rafael into its
body, and drew it lengthwise forth. The <i>tintorera</i>,
mortally wounded, sprung several feet out
of the water, and fell striking out furiously with
its tail, which fortunately did not reach me.
For a space I struggled, half blinded by the
crimson foam that beat against my face; but
as I beheld the huge carcass of the enemy floating
a lifeless mass upon the surface, I gave vent
to a triumphant shout, which, spite of the storm,
might be heard on either coast.</p>

<p>Day-light began to dawn as I gained the
shore, in a state of utter exhaustion from the
exertion I had undergone. The fishermen were
raising their nets, and, as I arrived, the tide
washed upon the coast the <i>tintorera</i> and Rafael's
ghastly remains. It was soon spread abroad
that I had endeavored to rescue my friend from
his horrible fate, and my heroic conduct was
lauded to the echo. But one person, and one
alone, suspected the truth&mdash;that person is now
my wife.</p>

<h2>PHANTOMS AND REALITIES.&mdash;AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h2>

<h3>PART THE SECOND&mdash;NOON.</h3>


<h4>IX.</h4>

<p>Things happen in the world every day which
appear incredible on paper. Individuals
may secretly acknowledge to themselves the
likelihood of such things, but the bulk of mankind
feel it necessary to treat them openly with
skepticism and ridicule. The real is sometimes
too real for the line and plummet of the established
criticism. It is the province of art to
avoid these exceptional incidents, or to modify
and adapt them so that they shall appear to
harmonize with universal humanity. Hence it
is that fiction is often more truthful than biography;
and it is obvious enough that it ought
to be so, if it deal only with materials that are
reconcilable with the general experience.</p>

<p>But I am not amenable to the canons of art.
I am not writing fiction. I am relating facts;
and if they should appear unreasonable or improbable,
I appeal, for their vindication, to the
candor of the reader. Every man, if he looks
back into the vicissitudes of his life, will find
passages which would be pronounced pure exaggeration
and extravagance in a novel.</p>

<p>When I met Astr&aelig;a the next morning, I could
perceive those traces of deep anxiety which
recent circumstances had naturally left behind,
and which the flush and excitement of the preceding
evening had concealed. She was very
pale and nervous. She felt that the moment
had come when all disguises between us must
end forever, and she trembled on the verge of
disclosures that visibly shook her fortitude.</p>

<p>The day was calm and breathless. Scarcely
a leaf stirred in the trees, and the long shadows
slept without a ruffle on the turf. The stillness
of the place contrasted strangely with the tempest
of emotions that was raging in my heart.
I longed to get into the air. I felt the house
stifling, and thought that I should breathe more
freely among the branches of the little wood
that looked so green and cool down by the
margin of the stream. There was a rustic seat
there under a canopy of drooping boughs, close
upon the water and the bridge, where we could
enjoy the luxury of perfect solitude. Requesting
her to follow me, I went alone into the wood.</p>

<p>The interval seemed to me long before she
came; and when she did come, she was paler
and more agitated than before. I tried to give
her confidence by repeated protestations of my
devotion; and as she seemed to gather courage
from the earnestness of my language, I again
and again renewed the pledges which bound me
to her, at any risk our position might demand.</p>

<p>"It is that," she exclaimed, "which gives
me hope and comfort. You have had time to
reflect on these pledges, and weigh the consequences
they involve, and you now repeat them
to me with an ardor which I should do you a
great wrong to doubt. I entirely trust to you.
If I am deceived, I will try still to be just, and
hardly blame you so much as the world, which
few men can relinquish for love."</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which she gradually
recovered her self-composure. I felt that
these expressions gave me a nobler motive for
surrendering every thing for her sake. She
seemed to make me a hero by the penalties my
devotion enforced upon me; and I was eager to
prove myself capable of the most heroic sacrifices.
In the abyss of an overwhelming passion,
where reason is imprisoned by the senses, every
man is willing to be a martyr.</p>

<p>"You have required of me, Astr&aelig;a," said I,
"no, not required; but you have placed before
me the possibility of sufferings and trials resulting
from our union&mdash;loss of friends, the surrender
of many things that enter into the ordinary
scheme of married life, and that are considered
by the world indispensable to its happiness.
I am ready to relinquish them all. I
have looked for this end. I know not why it
should be so, nor does it give me a moment's
concern. I only know that I love you passionately,
and that life is desolation to me without
you. Let us therefore have no further delay.
All impediments are now out of our path. We
have our destinies in our own hands. Let us
knit them into one, and disappoint the scandal
and malignity which, from that hour, can exercise
no further influence over us."</p>

<p>"You spoke," returned Astr&aelig;a, looking with
a calm, clear gaze into my face, as if she penetrated
my soul, "you spoke of married life."</p>

<p>The question surprised me. It was her look
more than her words that conveyed a meaning,
indistinct, but full of terrible suggestions. It
was a key to a thousand painful conjectures,
which flashed upon me in an instant, leaving
confusion and giddiness behind, and nothing
certain but the fear of what was to follow. I
could not answer her; or, rather, did not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
how to answer her, and merely tried to reassure
her with a smile, which I felt was hollow and
unnatural.</p>

<p>"One word," she proceeded, in the same
tone, "must dispel that dream forever. It is
not for us that serene life you speak of. It is
not for me. Our destinies, if they be knit together,
must be cemented by our own hands, not
at the altar in the church, but in the sight of
heaven&mdash;a bond more solemn, and imposing a
more sacred obligation."</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe the effect of
these expressions. A cold dew crept over my
body, and I felt as if a paralysis had struck my
senses. Yet at the same moment, and while
she was speaking so quietly and deliberately,
and uttering words, under the heavy weight of
which the fabric I had reared in my imagination
crumbled down, and fell with a crash that smote
my brain&mdash;a crowd of memories came upon me&mdash;isolated
words and gestures, the dark allusions
of the dwarf, and the warnings of Astr&aelig;a
herself&mdash;a crowd of things that were all dark
before were now lighted up. As the stream of
electricity flies along the chain, traversing link
after link and mile after mile, with a rapidity
that baffles calculation, so my thoughts flashed
over every incident of the past. I now understood
it all&mdash;the mystery that lay buried in
Astr&aelig;a's words and abstractions&mdash;the vacant
heart&mdash;the hope that looked out from her eyes,
and then fled back to be quenched in silent
despair&mdash;her yearnings for solitude and repose&mdash;the
devotional spirit that, blighted in the world,
and condemned to be shut out from seeking
happiness in social conventions, had fallen back
upon its own lonely strength, and made to
itself a faith of passion! It was all plain to
me now. But there were explanations yet to
come.</p>

<p>"Astr&aelig;a!" I cried, hoarsely, and I felt the
echoes of the name moaning through the trees.
"Astr&aelig;a! What is the meaning of these
dreadful words? Have you not pledged your
faith to me?"</p>

<p>"Irrevocably!" she returned.</p>

<p>"Then what new impediment has arisen to
our union?"</p>

<p>"None that has not existed all along. Have
you not seen it darkening every hour of our intercourse?
Have you not understood it in the
fear that has given such intensity to feelings
which, had all been open before us, would have
been calm and unperturbed?&mdash;that has imparted
to love, otherwise sweet and tranquil, the
wild ardor of obstructed passion? Your instincts
must have told you, had you allowed
yourself a moment of reflection, that the woman
who consents to immolate her pride, her delicacy,
her fame, for the man she loves, must be
fettered by ties which leave her no alternative between
him and the world. Why am I here
alone with you?"</p>

<p>This was not said in a tone of reproach, but
it sounded like reproach, and wounded me. It
was all true. I ought to have understood that
suffering of her soul which, now that the clouds
were rolling back from before my eyes, had become
all at once intelligible. But to be surprised
into such a discovery, to have misunderstood
her unspoken agonies and sacrifices, jarred
upon me, and made me feel as if my nature
were not lofty enough to comprehend, by its
own unassisted sympathies, the grandeur of her
character. I imagined myself humiliated in her
presence, and this consideration was paramount,
for the moment, over all others. It stripped my
devotion of all claim to a heroism kindred to
her own, and deprived me of the only merit
that could render me worthy of her love. Yet
in the midst of this conflict, other thoughts
came flooding upon me; and voices from the
world I was about to relinquish for her rung
like a knell upon my ears. There were still
explanations to come that might afford me some
refuge from these tortures.</p>

<p>"Yes, Astr&aelig;a, I was conscious of some obstruction;
but how could I divine what it was?
Even now I must confess myself bewildered.
But as all necessity for further reserve is at an
end, you will be candid and explicit with me.
What is the impediment that stands in the way
of our union?"</p>

<p>I did not intend it, but I was aware, while I
was speaking, that there was ice in my voice,
and that the words issued from my lips as if
they were frozen.</p>

<p>"You mean," she replied, coldly, but in a
tone that conveyed a feeling of rising scorn,
"you mean our marriage?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"I never can be your wife."</p>

<p>As I had anticipated some such statement, I
ought not to have betrayed the amazement
with which I looked at her; but it was involuntary.
I did not ask her to go on; seeing, however,
that I expected it, she added,</p>

<p>"I am the wife of another!"</p>

<p>I started from my seat, and, in a paroxysm
of frenzy, paced up and down before her. I did
not exclaim aloud, "You have deceived me!"
but my flashing eyes and flushed brow expressed
it more eloquently than language. She bore
this in silence for a few minutes, and then addressed
me again,</p>

<p>"I said I would try not to blame you. I
blame only myself. Like all men, you are
strong in protestations, and feeble, timid, and
vacillating in action. You are thinking now of
the world, which only last night you so courageously
despised. A few hours ago, you believed
yourself so superior to the common weaknesses
of your sex, that you were ready to make
the most heroic sacrifices. What has become
of that vehement resolution, that brave self-reliance?
Vanished on the instant you are
put to the proof. Believe me, you have miscalculated
your own nature&mdash;all men do in such
cases. A woman whose heart is her life, and
who shrinks in terror from all other conflicts, is
alone equal to such a struggle as this. The
world is your proper sphere; do not deceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
yourself. You could not sustain isolation; you
would be forever looking back, as you are at
this moment, for the consolations and support
you had abandoned."</p>

<p>"No, Astr&aelig;a!" I exclaimed; "you wrong
me. My resolution is unchanged; but you must
allow something for the suddenness&mdash;the
shock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I give you credit," she resumed, "for the
best intentions. It is not your fault that habit
and a constitutional acquiescence in it have left
you no power over your will in great emergencies.
You are what the world has made you;
and you should be thankful that you have found
it out in time. For me, what does it matter?
By coming here, I have violated obligations for
which society will hold me accountable, though
they pressed like prison-bars upon me, lacerating
and corroding my soul. It will admit no excuse
for their abandonment in the unutterable
misery they entailed. I am as guilty by this
one step as if I had plunged into the depths of
crime. The world does not recognize the doctrine
that the real crime is in the admission of
the first disloyal thought; it only looks to appearances
which I have outraged. I have compromised
myself beyond redemption. I can not
retrieve my disgrace, though I am as pure in
act as if we had never met. But I have
done it upon my own responsibility, and upon
me alone let the penalty fall. From this hour
I release you."</p>

<p>Her language, and the dignity of her manner,
stung me. She seemed to tower above me in
the strength of her will, and the firmness with
which she went through a scene that shattered
my nerves fearfully, and made me equally
irresolute of speech and purpose. While I was
harrowed by an agony that fluttered in every
pulse, she was perfectly calm and collected,
and, rising quietly from her seat, turned away
to leave me.</p>

<p>This action roused me from the stupor of indecision.
The situation in which she was placed&mdash;making
so new a demand upon my feelings&mdash;gave
me a sort of advantage which I thought
might enable me to recover the ground I had
lost. By the exercise of magnanimity in such
circumstances, I should vindicate myself in her
estimation, and prove myself once more worthy
of the opinion she had originally formed of me.
It was something nobler, I thought, to embrace
ruin at this moment for her sake, than if I had
known it all along, and had come to that conclusion
by a deliberate process of reasoning.
This train of subtle sophistry, which has taken
up some space to detail, struck me like a flash
of light on the instant I thought I was about
to lose her. I could bear all things but that,
and could suffer all things to avert it. And so
again I became her suitor, in a kind of proud
generosity, that flattered itself by stooping to
gain its own ends. How mean and selfish the
human heart is when our desires are set in
opposition to our duties!</p>

<p>I sprang forward, and clasped her eagerly by
the hands. I flung myself on my knees before
her. Tears leaped into my eyes. I told her
that I had wronged her&mdash;that we had wronged
each other&mdash;that I had never wavered in my
faith&mdash;that we were bound to each other&mdash;and
that we could commit no crime now except that
of doubting, at either side, the truth of the love
which had brought us there, and for which I,
like her, had relinquished the world forever.</p>

<p>She had a woman's heart, full of tenderness
and pity; and it is the tendency of woman's
nature to forgive and believe where the affections
are interested, without exacting much
proof or penalty. She bent over me, and raised
me in her arms. The storm had passed
away, and she trusted in me implicitly again.</p>

<p>Her history? What was it? We shall come
to it presently.</p>


<h4>X.</h4>

<p>The storm had passed away; but it left
traces of disorder behind, such as a tempest
leaves in a garden over which it has recently
swept. The collision had set us both thinking.
We felt as if a mist had suddenly melted down,
and enabled us, for the first time, to see clearly
before us. We felt this differently, but we were
equally conscious of the change.</p>

<p>"I am the wife of another!"</p>

<p>The words still throbbed in my brain. I
could not escape from the images they conjured
up. I could not rid myself of the doubts and
distrusts, shapeless, but oppressive, thus forced
upon me. I could not recall a single incident
out of which, until these words were uttered,
I could have extracted the remotest suspicion
of her situation. To me, and to every person
around her, Astr&aelig;a had always appeared a free
agent. She bore no man's name. She acted
with perfect independence, so far as outward
action was concerned; and the only restraint
that ever seemed to hang upon her was some
dark memory, or heavy sorrow, that clouded her
spirit. Here was the mystery solved. She was
a bond-woman, and had hidden her fetters from
the world. In our English society, where usages
are strict, and shadows upon a woman's reputation,
even where there is not a solitary stain,
blot it out forever, this was strange and painful.
It looked like a deception, and, in the
estimate of all others, it was a deception. This
was the way in which it first presented itself to
me. I had not emancipated myself from the
influence of opinion, or habit, or prejudice, or
whatever that feeling may be called which instinctively
refers such questions to the social
standard. The recoil was sudden and violent.
Yet, nevertheless, I felt rebuked by the superiority
of Astr&aelig;a in the strength of purpose and moral
courage she displayed under circumstances
which would have overwhelmed most other women.
Her steadfastness had a kind of grandeur
in it, that seemed to look down upon my misgivings
as failings or weaknesses of character.
And she sat silently in this pomp of a clear
and unfaltering resolution, while I, fretted and
chafed, exhibited too plainly my double sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
alike of the injury she had inflicted on me, and
of the ascendency which, even in the hour of injury,
she exercised over me. It was the stronger
mind, made stronger by the force of love, overawing
the weaker, made weaker by the prostration
of the affections.</p>

<p>And she, too, had something to reflect upon
in this moment of mutual revolt.</p>

<p>She loved me passionately. She loved me
with a devotion capable of confronting all risks
and perils. The profound unselfishness and
truthfulness of her love made her serene at
heart, and inspired her with a calmness which
enabled her to endure the worst without flinching.
There was not a single doubt of herself
in her own mind. Her faith gave her the fortitude
needful for the martyr. When a woman
trusts every thing to this faith, and feels her
reliance on it sufficient for the last sacrifice, she
is prepared for an issue which no man contemplates,
and which no man is able to encounter
with an equal degree of courage or confidence in
his own constancy. With her it is otherwise.
By one step, the ground is closed up behind her
forever; no remorse can help her, no suffering
can make atonement, or propitiate reconciliation;
she can not retract, she can not retreat,
she can not return! No man is ever placed in
this extremity, though his sin be of a ten-fold
deeper dye. Such is the moral justice of society.
He has always a space to fall back upon&mdash;he
has always room to retrieve, to recover, to
reinstate himself. But she is lost! The foreknowledge
of her doom, which shuts out hope,
makes her strong in endurance; the magnitude
of her sacrifice enhances and deepens the idolatry
from which it proceeded; she clings to it,
and lives in it evermore, as the air which she
must breathe, or die. But he? He has ever
the backward hope, the consciousness of the
power of retracing his steps. The world is
there behind him, as he left it, its eager tumult
still floating into his ears from afar off, its reckless
gayeties, its panting ambition, its occupations,
and its pleasures; and he knows he can
re-enter it when he lists. He, then, if he consent
to commit the great treason against a confiding
devotion, can afford to be bold; that boldness
which has always an escape and safeguard
in reserve! But it is this consideration which
makes him irresolute and infirm&mdash;it is this
which dashes his resolves with hesitation, and
makes him temporize and play fast and loose in
his thoughts, while his lips overflow with the
fervid declamation of passion. He may believe
himself to be sincere; but no man understands
himself who believes that he has renounced the
world. The world has arranged it otherwise
for him.</p>

<p>The whole conditions of her position were
clear to Astr&aelig;a. She had not now considered
them for the first time; but the mistrust, not of
my love for her, but of my character, was now
first awakened; and if she trembled for the consequences,
it was not for her own sake, but for
mine. Men can not comprehend this abnegation
of self in women, and, not being able to
comprehend it, they do not believe in it. It
requires an elevation and generosity rare in the
crisis of temptation, and, perhaps, also, an entire
change of surrounding circumstances and
responsibilities, to enable them to estimate it
justly; the power of bestowing happiness through
a life-long sacrifice, instead of the privilege of
receiving it at a trifling risk.</p>

<p>When we had become a little more at our
ease, and I had endeavored by a variety of commonplaces
to revive her faith in me, Astr&aelig;a,
with the most perfect frankness, entered upon
her history. I will not break up the narrative
by the occasional interruptions to which it was
subjected by my curiosity and impatience, but
preserve it as nearly entire as I can.</p>

<p>"There is a period," said Astr&aelig;a, "in all our
lives when we pass through delusions which an
enlarged experience dispels. We too often begin
by making deities, and end by total skepticism.
I suppose, like every body else, I had
my season of self-deception, although it has
not made me an absolute infidel."</p>

<p>And as she said this, she looked at me with
a smile so full of sweetness, that I yielded myself
up implicitly to the enchantment.</p>

<p>"I was devotedly attached to my father,"
she continued; "he educated me, and was so
proud of the faculties which his own careful
tending drew into activity, that it was the
greatest happiness of my life to deserve the
kindness which anticipated their development.
There was no task my father set to me I did
not feel myself able to conquer by the mere
energy of the love I bore him. The education
he bestowed upon me was not the cultivation
of the intellect alone&mdash;I owe him a deeper
debt, fatally as I have discharged it&mdash;for it
was his higher aim to educate my affections.
He succeeded so well, that I would at any moment
have cheerfully surrendered my own fondest
desires, or have sacrificed life itself, to comply
with any wish of his. You shall judge whether
I have a right to say that I loved him better
than I loved myself.</p>

<p>"My mother was a beauty. A woman of
whom one can say nothing more than that she
was a beauty, is misplaced in the home of a
man of intellect. One can never cease wondering
how it is that such men marry such
women; but I believe there are no men so
easily ensnared by their own imaginations, or
who trouble themselves so little about calculating
consequences. They make an ideal, and
worship it; and, as your true believers contrive
to refresh their motionless saints by new draperies
and tinsel, so they go on perpetually investing
their idols with fictitious attributes, to
encourage and sustain their devotions. But
that sort of self-imposition can not last very
long; and the best possible recipe for stripping
the idol of its false glitter is to marry it! My
father made this discovery in due time. He
found that beauty without enthusiasm or intellect
is even less satisfying than a picture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
which is, at least, suggestive, and leaves something
to the imagination. There was no sympathy
between them. She existed only in company,
which, from the languor of her nature,
she hardly seemed to enjoy. Change, and
variety, and the flutter of new faces were as
necessary to her as they were wearisome to
him; and so gradually and imperceptibly the
distance widened between them, and his whole
affections were concentrated on me. This may
in some measure account for the formation of
my character. I was neither weakened nor
benefited by maternal tenderness; and my studies
and habits, shaped and regulated by my
father, imparted to me a strength and earnestness
which&mdash;now that they avail me nothing&mdash;may
speak of as existing in the past.</p>

<p>"It is nearly ten years since my mother
died; she went out as a flower dies, drooping
slowly, and retaining something of its sweetness
to the end. My father outlived her several
years. That was the happiest period of my
life. There was not a break in the love that
bound us together. But there came a struggle
at last between us&mdash;a struggle in which that
love was bitterly tried and tested on both
sides.</p>

<p>"I made a deity to myself, as most young
people do, especially when they are flattered
into the belief that they are more <i>spirituelle</i>
and capable of judging for themselves, than
the rest of the world. It was a girlish fancy;
all girls have such fancies, and look back upon
them afterward as they look back upon their
dreams, trying to collect and put together forms
and colors that fade rapidly in the daylight of
experience.</p>

<p>"One of our visitors made an impression upon
me; perhaps that is the best way to describe
it. He had a sombre and poetical air&mdash;that
was the first thing that touched me&mdash;an oval
face, very pale and thoughtful, and chiseled to
an excess of refinement; a sensitive mouth;
dark, melancholy eyes; and black, lustrous
hair. I remember he had quite a Spanish or
Italian cast of features; and that was dangerous
to a young girl steeped in the lore of history
and chivalry. You think it strange, perhaps,
I should make this sort of confession to
<i>you</i>; you expect that I should rather suffer you
to believe that, until we met, I had never been
disturbed by the sentiment of love; yet you
may entirely believe it. This was a mere
phantasy&mdash;the prescience of what was to come&mdash;the
awakening of the consciousness of a
capacity of loving which, until now, was never
stirred in its depths. It merely showed me
what was in my nature, but did not draw it
out.</p>

<p>"The fascination was on the surface; but,
while it lasted, I thought it intense; and such
is the contradiction in the constitution of youth,
that a little opposition from my father only
helped to strengthen it. In the presence of that
sad face, into which was condensed an irresistible
influence, I was silent and timid, frightened
at the touch of his white hands, and so confused
that I could neither speak to him, nor
look at him: but in my father's presence, when
we talked of him, and my father hinted distrusts
and antipathies, I was bold in his defense,
and soared into an enthusiasm that often
surprised us both. It was evident that I was
in love&mdash;to speak by the card&mdash;and that the
admonitions of experience were thrown away
upon me.</p>

<p>"My father was grieved at this discovery,
when it really came to take a serious shape of
resistance to his advice. As yet, we had only
flirted round the confines of the subject, and
neither of us had openly recognized it as a
reality. The action of the drama was in my
own brain. The hero of my fantastic reveries
regarded me only as a precocious child: was
amused, or, at the utmost, interested by my
admiration of him, which he could not fail to
detect; and it was not until he imagined he
had traced a deeper sentiment in my shy and
embarrassed looks, that he began to feel any
emotion himself. But the emotions which
spring out of vanity or compassion, which
come only as a sort of generous or pitying acknowledgment
of an unsought devotion, have
no stability in them. It is more natural, and
more likely to insure duration of love that they
should originate at the other side. Woman
was formed to be sued and won; it is the law
of our organization. Men value our affection
in proportion to the efforts it has cost to gain
them. The rights of a difficult conquest are
worn with pride and exultation, while the fruits
of an easy victory are held in indifference.
These things, however, were mysteries to me
then.</p>

<p>"There was a kind of love-scene between us.
I can hardly recall any thing of it, except that
I thought him more grand and noble than ever,
and full of a magnificent patronage of my
nerves and my ignorance. He was several
years older than I was, which made a great
distance between us, and made me look up to
him with a superstitious homage. I remember
nothing more about it, only that when I left
him, I felt as if I had suddenly grown up into
a woman.</p>

<p>"And now came the beginning of the struggle.</p>

<p>"We had other visitors who were better liked
by my father. I could not then understand his
objections to my Orlando. I have understood
them since, and know that he was right in that,
if he erred in the rest.</p>

<p>"Among our visitors was one whom I can
not speak of without a shudder. There was in
him a combination of qualities calculated to inspire
me with aversion, which grew from day to
day into loathing. I do not believe my father
really liked that man. Circumstances, however,
had given him an influence in our house, against
which it was vain for me to contend. His family
was closely connected with my mother;
and my father had acquired an estate through
his marriage, with which these people were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
mixed up as trustees; they had, in fact, a lien
upon us, which it was impossible to shake off;
and by this means maintained a position with
us which was at once so familiar and harassing
to me, that nothing but my devotion to my
father restrained me from an open mutiny
against them.</p>

<p>"This man, who was not much my senior in
years, but who seemed to have been born old,
and to have lived centuries for every year of my
life, entertained the most violent passion for me.
I had no suspicion of it at first; and as the
closeness of our relations threw us constantly
together, I was feeding it unknowingly for a
long time before I discovered it. I will spare
you what I felt when I made that discovery&mdash;the
horror! the despair!</p>

<p>"When I compared this man, loathsome and
hideous to me, with him who was the Orlando,
the Bayard, the Crichton of my foolish dreams,
it made me sick at heart. So deep was the detestation
he inspired, that, young as I was, I
would have gladly renounced my own choice to
have escaped from him. But there was one
consideration paramount even to that; it was
my father's desire that I should marry him.</p>

<p>"By some such sorcery as wicked demons in
the wise allegories of fable obtain a control over
good spirits, the demon who had thus risen up
in my path obtained an ascendency over my
father. It was impossible that he could have
persuaded my father, who was clear-sighted and
sagacious, into the belief that he possessed a
single attribute of goodness; it must have been
by the force of a fascination, such as serpents
are said to exercise over children, that he wrought
his ends. And the comparison was never applied
with greater justice, for my father was as
guileless as a child in mere worldly affairs, while
the other was a subtle compound of cunning and
venom, glazed over with a most hypocritical exterior.</p>

<p>"He worked at his purpose for months and
months in the dark, by artifices which assisted
his progress without betraying his aim. He
adroitly avoided an abrupt disclosure of his design,
for he knew, or feared, that if it came too
suddenly, it would have shocked even my father.
He saw that my fancy was taken up elsewhere,
and the first part of his plot was, to prejudice
and poison my father's mind against his rival.
In this he effectually succeeded. But it was a
more difficult matter to bring round his own
object, and he never could have achieved it,
with all his skill, had he not been so mixed up
with our affairs as to have it in his power to
involve my father in a net-work of embarrassments.
The meshes were woven round him
with consummate ingenuity, and every effort at
extrication only drew them tighter and tighter.</p>

<p>"Had I known as much of the world then as
I do now I might have acted differently. But
I was a girl; my sensibility was easily moved;
my terrors were easily alarmed; and I loved
my father too passionately to be able to exercise
a calm judgment where his safety was concerned.
It was this devotion&mdash;impetuous and
unreflecting&mdash;that gave an advantage to the
fiend, of which he availed himself unrelentingly,
and which threw me, bound and fettered, at his
feet.</p>

<p>"I will not dwell on these memories. My
heart was harrowed by a terrible conflict. I
know not how it might have been, had I not
gathered a little strength from wounded pride.
A circumstance came to my relief which crushed
my enthusiasm, and from that instant determined
my fate.</p>

<p>"My father had often thrown out doubts of
the sincerity of him to whom I looked up with
so much admiration; and at last he spoke more
explicitly and urgently. He told me that the
hero of my dreams was merely trifling with my
feelings, and amusing himself at the expense of
my credulity&mdash;in short, that he was no better
than a libertine. I revolted against these cruel
accusations, and repelled them by asserting that
he was the noblest and truest of human beings.
But my father knew more of him than I did.
Even while these painful discussions were going
on between us, news arrived that he had been
detected in a heartless conspiracy to entrap and
carry off a ward in chancery&mdash;a discovery which
compelled him to fly the country.</p>

<p>"I was stunned and humiliated. The dream
was over. The idol was broken, and the shrine
degraded forever. What resource should women
have in such cases if pride did not come
to their help&mdash;that pride which smiles while the
heart is bleeding, and makes the world think
that we do not suffer! They know not what
we suffer&mdash;what we hide! Our education trains
us up in a mask, which is often worn to the
end, when the secret that has fed upon our
hearts, and consumed our lives, day by day,
descends into the dark grave with us! My
sufferings at the time were very great&mdash;I thought
they would kill me. What mattered it to me
then how they disposed of me. Poor fool! I
looked in on my desolated fancy, and gave myself
up for lost.</p>

<p>"It was in this mood the machinations of
that man whom I abhorred triumphed over me.
My father's affairs had become hopelessly entangled
in his, and a proposal to avert chancery
suits and settle disputed titles by a union between
the families of the litigants presented the
only means of adjustment. My father listened
to this insidious proposal at first reluctantly;
then, day by day, as difficulties thickened, he
became more reconciled to it; and, at length,
he broke it to me, with a deprecating gentleness
that never sued in vain to the heart that idolized
him. I had nothing left in the world but
my father to love. Under any circumstances
my love for him would have made me waver.
As it was, wounded and hopeless, galled, deceived,
and cast off&mdash;for I felt as all girls do,
and was thoroughly in earnest in my sentimental
misery&mdash;my love for him lightened the sacrifice
he prayed, rather than demanded at my
hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Girl as I was. I could see the change that
had passed over my father. The strong man
was subdued and broken down. His clear understanding
had given way; even his heart was
no longer as generous and impulsive as it used
to be. I could not bear to witness these alterations;
and when I was told that it was in my
power to relieve him from the weight that
pressed upon him, what could I do?</p>

<p>"There were many violent struggles&mdash;many
fits of tears and solitary remorse; but they all
yielded to that imperative necessity, to that
claim upon my feelings, which was paramount
to every thing else. The first step was a contract
of marriage, which I was simply required
to sign. I was too young then to marry!
This consideration was thrown in as a sort of
tender forbearance to me, which, it was hoped,
would propitiate my reluctant spirit. And from
that hour, the demon, claiming me for his own,
was incessant in his attendance upon me. I
had hoped by that act to shake him off my
father; but he was the Old Man of the Waters
to his drowning victim, and at every moment
only clutched and clung to him more closely.</p>

<p>"At last my father fell ill. First, he moped
about the house, with a low, wearing cough.
None of his old resources availed him. He
couldn't read; the pleasant things he used to
talk of&mdash;books, character, philosophy&mdash;no longer
interested him. The placid mind was growing
carped and restless. He was absorbed in his
ailments. Trifles vexed him, and instead of the
large and genial subjects which formerly engrossed
him, he was taken up with petty annoyances.
Oh, with what agony I watched
that change from day to day! Then from the
drawing-room to the bed, from whence he never
rose again.</p>

<p>"It was in his last sickness&mdash;toward the
close&mdash;when the wings of the Angel of Death
were darkening his lids, and his utterance was
thickening, and his vision becoming dimmer and
dimmer, that he called me to his side. He knew
the horror that was in my thoughts; but I was
already pledged, and it was not a time for me
to shrink, when he, in whom my affections were
garnered up, besought me to make his death-bed
happy by completing the sacrifice. There
were those around us who said that it was
merely to ease <i>his</i> mind, that he might feel he
did not leave me behind him alone and without
a protector; that the marriage would be performed
in his presence; that we should then
separate, and that my husband&mdash;oh, how I
have hated that word! what images of wrong
and cruelty are condensed into it!&mdash;would regard
that ghastly ceremony only as a guarantee
that when my grief had abated, and the signs
of mourning were put off, I should consent to
become his wife before the world. I believed in
that and trusted to it. It was all written down
and witnessed, that he would not enforce this
marriage till time had soothed and reconciled
me to it; and as the realization of it was to
depend upon myself, I thought I was secure
against the worst. Upon these conditions I was
married beside the death-bed of my father.</p>

<p>"The plot was deeply laid. The snare was
covered with flowers. I was nominally free. I
was the wife, and not the wife, of him who,
when a little time had passed away, and my
father was in the grave, and I was at his mercy,
assumed the right of asserting over me the
authority of a husband. I did not then know
the full extent of my dependence. Upon the
failure of my consent, the whole property was
to devolve upon him. Of that I thought little;
it was a cheap escape from a bondage I abhorred,
if, by surrendering all I possessed, I <i>could</i>
escape. There was nothing left in my own
hands, but the power of withholding my consent,
and I did withhold it; and my aversion
increased with the base, unmanly, and vindictive
means he used to wring it from me.</p>

<p>"Years passed away; he was ever in my
path, blighting me with threats and scoffs.
My life was one continued mental slavery. He
had the right, or he usurped it, of holding me
in perpetual bondage&mdash;hovering about me,
watching my actions, and subjecting me to a
persecution which, invisible to every body else,
was felt by me in the minutest trifles. And all
this time my heart, shut up and stifled, felt a
longing, such as prisoners feel, to breathe the
free air, to find its wings and escape. I was
conscious of a capacity for happiness; I felt
that my existence was wasting under a hideous
influence&mdash;that my situation was cruel and
anomalous&mdash;that it was equally guilty to stay
and feed the rebellion of my blood, that might
at last drive me mad, or to fly from the evil
thoughts that fascinated and beset me;&mdash;and
long contemplation of this corroding misery convinced
me that the greater guilt was the hourly
falsehood&mdash;the constant mutiny of my soul&mdash;the
sin I was committing against nature by
continuing to tolerate the semblance of an obligation
that made me almost doubt the justice
of heaven!</p>

<p>"Again and again he renewed the subject,
only to be again and again repulsed with increased
bitterness and scorn. The sternness
of my resolution gradually obtained a victory
over his perseverance. No man, be his devotion
as intense as it may, can persist in this
way, when he is thoroughly assured that a
woman hates or despises him; and <i>he</i> had ample
reason to know that I did both. Threats
failed&mdash;hints of scandal and defamation failed&mdash;prayers
and entreaties failed&mdash;he tried them
all; and he saw at last that my determination
was irrevocable. I would not redeem my
pledge. I took all the consequence of the
perfidy. I submitted to the ignominy of his
taunts and reproaches, and even admitted their
justice, rather than stain my soul with a blacker
crime. What was left to him? His arts
were baffled&mdash;his pride turned to dust&mdash;his love
rejected? What was left to him out of this
ruin of his long cherished scheme? <span class="smcap">Revenge</span>!</p>

<p>"Although he could not force me to fulfill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the contract, he could blast my life in its bloom&mdash;wither
the tree to the core&mdash;make a desert
round it&mdash;poison the very atmosphere that gave
it nourishment and strength&mdash;and wait patient&mdash;to
see it die, leaf by leaf, and branch by branch,
This was his devilish project. Love&mdash;if ever
so sacred a passion had found its way into his
soul&mdash;was transformed into hate, deadly and
unrelenting; the red current had become gall;
and the same slow, insatiable energy, with
which he had before urged and forced his suit,
was now applied to torture and distract me. I
wonder it did not drive me to some act of desperation!</p>

<p>"And all this time I moved through society
like others. Nobody suspected the vulture that
was at my heart; and I had to endure the
wretched necessity of acting a daily lie to the
world. It gave a false severity to my manner&mdash;it
made me seem austere and lofty, where I
only meant to avert approaches which it would
have been criminal to have admitted and deceived.
And I had need of all that repellant
armor; and it served me, and saved me&mdash;till I
met you!</p>

<p>"Shall I proceed any farther? Shall I tell
you how a new state of existence seemed insensibly
opening before me?&mdash;how the want in
my heart became unconsciously filled?&mdash;and
that which had been a dream to me all my
life long, vague, flitting, and undefined, was
now a reality, clear, fixed, and distinct? What
that sympathy was it is needless to ask, which
made me feel that your history was something
like my own&mdash;that you, too, had some discontent
with the world, that made you yearn for
peace and solitude, and the refuge of love, like
me. I fought bravely at first. You know
not how earnestly I questioned myself&mdash;how I
probed my wounded spirit, and battled with the
temptation. All that was hidden from you;
but it was not the less fierce and agonizing.
The blessed thought and hope of freedom, of a
happiness which I had never trusted myself to
contemplate, was a strong and blinding fascination.
I saw my wretchedness, and close at
hand its perilous remedy. Doomed either way,
which was I to choose? The world?&mdash;my
soul? All was darkness and terror to me.
Calamity had made me desperate; yet I was
outwardly calm and self-sustained. But I was
goaded too far at last; <i>he</i> goaded me; and my
resolution was taken; it was one plunge&mdash;and
all was over. I fled from the misery I could
no longer endure, and live; and I know the
cost&mdash;I know the penalty&mdash;I see before me the
retribution. Let it come&mdash;my fate is sealed!"</p>


<p>XI.</p>

<p>This narrative occupied a longer time in the
relation than in the shape to which I have
reduced it, for it was frequently interrupted by
questions and exclamations, which I have not
thought it necessary to insert here. When she
concluded, the day was already waning, and
the long shadows from the woods were stretching
down the stream, and the setting sun was,
here and there, blazing through the trees, like
focal rays caught on the surface of a burning-glass.
The haze of evening was gathering
round us, and settling over the little bridge which
was now slowly fading into the distance.</p>

<p>Astr&aelig;a had confided her whole life to me
with the utmost candor. The strong emotions
she exhibited throughout afforded the best proof,
if any were wanted, of her perfect sincerity.
There was nothing kept back&mdash;no <i>arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e</i>&mdash;no
false coloring; her real character came
out forcibly in this painful confession. Few
women would have had the requisite fortitude
to submit to such an ordeal, and take their
final stand upon a position which marked them
out as Pariahs in the eyes of the world. I felt
how great the misery must have been from
which she sought this terrible escape; and how
much greater was the strength of will that sustained
her in the resolution to embrace it.
Her wild sense of natural justice had risen in
resistance against laws which it appeared to
her more criminal to obey than to violate. It
was not a paroxysm of the passions&mdash;it was
not the sophistry that seeks for its own convenience
to arraign the dispensations of society;
it was a strong mind, contending in its own
right against obligations founded on force, and
violence, and wrong&mdash;asserting its claim to
liberate itself from trammels to which it had
never given a voluntary assent&mdash;recoiling from
a life of skepticism and hypocrisy, and the
frightful conflicts it entails between duty and
the instincts of reason and the heart&mdash;and prepared,
since no other alternative was left, to
suffer in itself alone, and in the consequences of
its own act, all obloquy, all vengeance the
world could inflict. That there lay beneath
this a grave error, undermining the foundations
upon which the whole social superstructure
rested, was, in a certain large and general
sense, sufficiently obvious to me. But who
could argue such questions against convictions
based upon individual and exceptional injuries?
Who could require, in the very moment and
agony of sacrifice, that she who had been thus
wronged and tortured, and who had never, of
her own free action, incurred the responsibility
from which she revolted, should offer herself up
a victim to laws that afforded her no protection,
and condemned her to eternal strife, and the
sins of a rebellious conscience? I would have
saved her if I could. It was my first impulse&mdash;my
most earnest desire. But of what avail
was the attempt? Where was she to find
refuge? Only one of two courses lay before
her&mdash;to return and fulfil her contract, or to
renounce the world: the first was doubtful,
perhaps impossible; the second, she had resolved
upon. Even if I were to hold back on
the brink of the precipice, it would not shake
her determination.</p>

<p>In this extremity and in the last resort, I felt
myself bound to her by every consideration of
love and honor. Honor! When that element
enters into our casuistry, the peril is at its height!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you never endeavored to release yourself
from this contract?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"He would not release me."</p>

<p>"Have you explicitly demanded it of him, so
that you should have the satisfaction of feeling
that you had tried all other means before you
broke the bond yourself?"</p>

<p>"I have demanded and besought it of him&mdash;prayed
to him&mdash;appealed to him, by his soul's
hopes here and hereafter, to release me. I
have laid my own perdition on his refusal&mdash;and
he still refused. I gave up all; offered to leave
England forever; to give him security that, be
my fate what it might, neither he nor his should
be troubled with me. To no purpose&mdash;he was
iron. He could have procured a separation,
which I could not. I gave him the means,
and would have borne any humiliation to obtain
my freedom. He would not release me; he
held me bound, that he might gloat his vengeance
upon my sufferings."</p>

<p>"And this man&mdash;this fiend&mdash;you have not
told me, Astr&aelig;a, who he is."</p>

<p>While I was speaking, I observed her looking
keenly through the mist that was collecting
about us. Some object had attracted her attention.
My eyes followed the direction hers
had taken, and I discerned a figure, apparently
wrapped up in a cloak, about the centre of the
bridge, on the near side. We watched it in
silence for a space of two or three minutes,
when it moved slowly from its position, and
winding down among the trees, took the path
that led directly to the spot where we were
seated. She grasped my arm, and cried in a
whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stand firm. Speak not. It is my deed,
not yours. The hour I have looked for through
long years of anguish is come at last. Fear
nothing for me!"</p>

<p>The figure approached, still enveloped in a
cloak, and stood exactly opposite to us. For
a moment&mdash;the most intense I ever remember&mdash;not
a word was uttered. At last, the stranger
spoke.</p>

<p>"It is, then, as I expected. I have tracked
you to your hiding-place, and I find you with
your paramour."</p>

<p>It was the voice of the dwarf! The blood
leaped in my veins, and, hardly conscious of
what I was doing, or meant to do, I sprang
from my seat. Astr&aelig;a rose at the same moment,
and interposed.</p>

<p>"If you have the least regard or respect for
me," she said, "do not interfere. For my sake,
control yourself."</p>

<p>"For <i>your</i> sake!" echoed the dwarf. "Do
you glory in <i>his</i> shame, as well as your own?"</p>

<p>"Shame!" cried Astr&aelig;a. "Take back the
foul word, and begone. You have no authority,
no rights here. The shame is yours, not mine&mdash;yours,
unmanly, pitiful, and mean, who have
taken advantage of a contract wrung from a
girl to doom the life of a woman to misery."</p>

<p>"Have I no authority?" quoth the dwarf.
"Listen to me&mdash;you must&mdash;you shall&mdash;if it kill
you in your heroics. I am your husband&mdash;my
authority is law. I can command you to my
foot, and you must obey me. You think you
are secure; but I will show you that you have
committed an egregious mistake. Believe me,"
he added, in a tone of supercilious mockery, for
which I could have inflicted summary chastisement&mdash;"believe
me, you only deceive yourself,
as you have tried to deceive me."</p>

<p>"In what have I tried to deceive you?" she
demanded. "I have been so explicit with you,
that none but the most contemptible of your
sex would have persisted at such a sacrifice of
pride and feeling. Pride? You have none.
Where you proffered love&mdash;oh! such love!&mdash;you
found aversion;&mdash;where you sought, sued,
and threatened, you received nothing in return
but loathing and scorn. And now, henceforth
and forever, I break all bonds between us.
Since you will not do it, I will&mdash;I <i>have</i> done it!
Obey you? I owe you no obedience. Be wise;
take my answer, and leave me."</p>

<p>"Not at your bidding, madam. I did not
come here to visit you in your retirement, and
be turned away so unceremoniously. It is not
my intention to leave you. Where you are,
there must I be too."</p>

<p>The insolent coolness with which this was
spoken, rendered it very difficult for me to submit
to the injunction Astr&aelig;a had imposed upon
me. I began to feel that <i>I</i>, too, had rights,
and that the course this husband-in-law was
pursuing, was not the best calculated to induce
me to surrender them.</p>

<p>"Where I am you shall never come again!"
returned Astr&aelig;a. "That is over. A gulf
yawns between us. Do not tempt it any
further."</p>

<p>"I will not be critical about words with you,"
said the dwarf. "If I am not to come where
you are, you shall come to me. It is the same
thing. You are only wasting your fine speeches.
I have come here to take you back to
London."</p>

<p>"To take me back?" she echoed. "Are
you mad? Do you believe such a thing credible?
I have chosen my own course; and no
power, authority, or force can turn me from it.
Take me back! Even were I willing to go&mdash;suppose
I were weak enough to repent the step
I have taken&mdash;can you not see&mdash;have you not
eyes and understanding to see and comprehend,
that it would be to your own eternal dishonor&mdash;that
it would only bring upon you the contempt
and derision of the world?"</p>

<p>"It is for me to judge of that. Come&mdash;we
are losing time, and it is growing dark already."</p>

<p>"Then why do you stay? Why do you not
go as you came. I have given you my answer;
and if you were to stand here forever, you will
get none other. Have you no particle of self-respect
left?"</p>

<p>"Whatever self-respect or pride I had," returned
the dwarf, in a low and bitter tone,
"you have trampled upon, and raised up a demoniac
spirit in this place. It might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
otherwise once. I loved you&mdash;ay! writhe under
the word&mdash;I loved you; but I was ill-favored,
misshapen, stunted, and loathsome to look upon.
You thought that love and ambition and high
thoughts could not take up with such a frame
as this&mdash;that they all went with straight limbs
and milky faces. Nature could not condescend
to endow the dwarf with the attributes of humanity.
But I was a man as well as they&mdash;had
the passions and hopes of a man, the capabilities
of good and evil. You never sought
the good; you never felt it to be your duty to
seek and cultivate the better qualities which
my own consciousness of my outward defects
made irresolute and wayward in development.
You only looked upon the surface: and in the
selfishness of your heart you spurned me from
you. You never thought of asking yourself
whether it was in your power to redeem and
elevate, for noble ends, the human soul that was
pent up in this weak and distorted body. You
never stopped to reflect whether, by your contumely
and pride of beauty, you were not destroying
the germs of all self-respect, perverting
the virtuous instincts into poisonous fangs, and
shattering to the core the best resolves of a
human being who might be better than yourself.
A word of kindness in season&mdash;a generous
construction of my character&mdash;an effort to
call my moral strength into action, might have
raised me to the dignity of the manhood it was
your pleasure to disdain and degrade&mdash;might
have given me the fortitude and the compensating
motive to resign you&mdash;might have saved
us both! But that word was never on your
lips&mdash;that effort you were not generous enough
to try. What I am, then, you have made me&mdash;bitter
to the dregs, engrossed by one thought,
living but for one object. Life is a curse to
me. Every new day that rises upon me,
humiliation and despair are before me. Do
you believe I will suffer this tamely? What
have I to lose? You hate me&mdash;I return you
hate for hate, loaded with the recollections of
years of scorn and defiance. Defiance? Ha!
ha! It is my turn now, and no remorse shall
step in between us to mitigate my vengeance!"</p>

<p>His voice rose almost into a shriek at the
close, he had worked himself up to such a height
of fanatic excitement; yet, notwithstanding the
denunciation with which he ended, it was impossible
not to be touched with pity for the real
suffering that had reduced him to this condition.
A great sorrow had converted this wretched
man into a human fiend; and I never before
believed that there were the elements of tenderness
in him which these references to the past
seemed dimly to light up. Astr&aelig;a heard it all
very calmly.</p>

<p>"We are not answerable for our likings or
antipathies," she replied; "and I am no more
accountable for my feeling than you are for your
shape. Had you possessed the instincts you
speak of&mdash;the manhood you claim for yourself,
you might have long since secured, at least, my
gratitude, and spared us both the ignominy of
this night. But it is useless to look back. I
have nothing more to say. Let us part&mdash;in
hate, if you will. I am indifferent alike to your
opinions and your vengeance. Avail yourself
of whatever power the law gives you; but here
we now part, never to meet again!"</p>

<p>As she said this, she moved away, and I still
lingered behind to protect her retreat, if it should
be necessary.</p>

<p>"No, madam; not so easily. We do not part.
I command you to leave this place, and go with
me. It is my pleasure. Do not compel me to
enforce it."</p>

<p>Seeing him rush forward to follow her, I placed
myself between them.</p>

<p>"I charge you," cried the dwarf, "to stand
out of my path. It will be dangerous."</p>

<p>"You have threatened me before," I exclaimed;
"and it is full time that you and I should
understand each other. I have an advantage
over you which I do not desire to use, except in
extremity; be careful, therefore, how you provoke
it. Advance no further, or I will not answer
for the consequences!"</p>

<p>"So, then, you champion her in her guilt,"
he cried.</p>

<p>"I know of no guilt," I replied. "I have
not interfered hitherto; I had no right to do so.
But I will not suffer any violence to be committed
toward her; she must be free to act as she
pleases!"</p>

<p>"And what right have you to interfere now?"</p>

<p>"The right which every man has to protect
a woman against outrage."</p>

<p>"I warn you for the last time!" exclaimed
the dwarf, his eyeballs flashing fire. "It is you
who have done this; you who have tempted
and destroyed her&mdash;destroyed us both. Do not
urge me to the retribution I thirst for. Put
your hand upon me; there is my outstretched
arm&mdash;only touch it with your fingers, and put
me on my defense!"</p>

<p>Astr&aelig;a was standing at my side.</p>

<p>"I charge you," she said, "to leave him,
and go into the house. He will not dare to
follow me!"</p>

<p>"I will dare the depths of perdition, and follow
you wherever you go. See how he shrinks
from me!&mdash;this champion and bully, for whom
you stand condemned and branded before the
world!"</p>

<p>"Bully!" I cried, "if you were not the feeble,
wretched thing you are, I would strike you
to the earth. It is you, not I, that have worked
out this shame for your own fiendish ends. Did
you not tell me that you helped and encouraged
our intercourse&mdash;that you saw feelings growing
up, and used all your arts to heighten them into
an attachment which you knew would bring
misery upon us all? For what purpose, devil
as you are, did you do this?"</p>

<p>"To break her heart&mdash;for she had broken
mine!"</p>

<p>"Be content, then, with what you have done,
and leave us. You have placed me in a position
which no fear of consequences can induce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
me to abandon. I will protect her to the last.
Look upon us henceforth as inseparable, and rid us
of your presence, lest I lose all self-command."</p>

<p>Grasping Astr&aelig;a's hand, and controlling myself
by a violent effort, I turned from him to
lead her toward the house.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this action which suddenly infuriated
the demon, who now looked more horrible
in the contortions of his unbridled rage
than ever; and as I turned I felt, rather than
saw, that he had coiled himself up to spring
upon me. Relieving myself from her, I instantly
faced him. His motions were as quick as
light. One hand was upon my chest, and the
other was fumbling under his cloak. Suspecting
his intention, I seized his right arm and
dragged it out. There was a pistol in his hand.
It was not a time to exercise much forbearance
in consideration of his physical inferiority, and
by desperate force I wrenched the pistol from
his grasp, and, tossing it over his head, flung
it into the river. In the struggle, however, it
had gone off, and, by the cry of pain he uttered,
I concluded that he was wounded. But I
was too much heated to think of that; and,
in the fierceness of the conflict between us, I
lifted him up by main strength, and flung him
upon the ground.</p>

<p>Leaving him there, I hastened to Astr&aelig;a,
and we both went into the house, taking care
to lock and bar the door, so that he could not
follow us. The windows of the sitting-room
went down close to the gravel-walk outside,
upon which they opened. These were already
secured, and we were safe.</p>

<p>As we sat there, half an hour afterward, a
low, piteous voice came wailing through the
shutters, uttering one word, which it repeated
at intervals, in a tone that pierced me to the
soul. "Astr&aelig;a! Astr&aelig;a! Astr&aelig;a!" It was a
voice so freighted with sorrow, that, had not
evil passions intervened to shut our hearts to
its petition, we must have relented and shown
mercy to him out of whose despair it issued.
But we held our breaths, hardly daring to look
in each other's faces, and moved not!</p>

<p>God! all the long night that wailing voice
seemed repeating, in fainter tones, "Astr&aelig;a!
Astr&aelig;a! Astr&aelig;a!" and she to whom it was addressed,
and to whom it appealed in vain&mdash;let
me not recall the memory! Many years have
since trampled out other recollections, but that
voice still seems to vibrate on my heart, and
the name still surges up as I heard it then,
sobbing through tears of mortal agony!</p>

<h2>MADAME DE GENLIS AND MADAME DE STA&Euml;L.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h2>


<p>Before the Revolution, I was but very
slightly acquainted with Madame de Genlis,
her conduct during that disastrous period having
not a little contributed to sink her in my estimation;
and the publication of her novel, "The
Knights of the Swan" (the <i>first</i> edition), completed
my dislike to a person who had so cruelly
aspersed the character of the queen, my sister
in-law.</p>

<p>On my return to France, I received a letter
full of the most passionate expressions of loyalty
from beginning to end; the missive being signed
Comtesse de Genlis: but imagining this could
be but a <i>plaisanterie</i> of some intimate friend of
my own, I paid no attention whatever to it.
However, in two or three days it was followed
by a second epistle, complaining of my silence,
and appealing to the great sacrifices the writer
had made in the interest of my cause, as giving
her a <i>right</i> to my favorable attention. Talleyrand
being present, I asked him if he could
explain this enigma.</p>

<p>"Nothing is easier," replied he; "Madame
de Genlis is unique. She has lost her own
memory, and fancies others have experienced a
similar bereavement."</p>

<p>"She speaks," pursued I, "of her virtues,
her misfortunes, and Napoleon's persecutions."</p>

<p>"Hem! In 1789 her husband was quite
ruined, so the events of that period took nothing
from <i>him</i>; and as to the tyranny of Bonaparte,
it consisted, in the first place, of giving her a
magnificent suite of apartments in the Arsenal;
and in the second place, granting her a pension
of six thousand francs a year, upon the sole
condition of her keeping him every month <i>au
courant</i> of the literature of the day."</p>

<p>"What shocking ferocity!" replied I, laughing;
"a case of infamous despotism indeed.
And this martyr to our cause asks to see me!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and pray let your royal highness grant
her an audience, were it only for once: I assure
you she is most amusing."</p>

<p>I followed the advice of M. de Talleyrand,
and accorded to the lady the permission she so
pathetically demanded. The evening before she
was to present herself, however, came a third
missive, recommending a certain Casimir, the
<i>ph&eacute;nix</i> of the <i>&eacute;poque</i>, and several other persons
besides; all, according to Madame de Genlis,
particularly celebrated people; and the postscript
to this effusion prepared me also beforehand for
the request she intended to make, of being
appointed governess to the children of my son
the Duc de Berry, who was at that time not even
married.</p>

<p>Just at this period it so happened that I was
besieged by more than a dozen persons of every
rank in regard to Madame de Sta&euml;l, formerly
exiled by Bonaparte, and who had rushed to
Paris without taking breath, fully persuaded
every one there, and throughout all France, was
impatient to see her again. Madame de Sta&euml;l
had a double view in thus introducing herself to
me; namely, to direct my proceedings entirely,
and to obtain payment of the two million francs
deposited in the treasury by her father during
his ministry. I confess I was not prepossessed
in favor of Madame de Sta&euml;l, for she also, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
1789, had manifested so much hatred toward
the Bourbons, that I thought all she could
possibly look to from us, was the liberty of
living in Paris unmolested: but I little knew
her. She, on her side, imagined that we ought
to be grateful to her for having quarreled with
Bonaparte&mdash;her own pride being, in fact, the
sole cause of the rupture.</p>

<p>M. de Fontanes and M. de Ch&acirc;teaubriand
were the first who mentioned her to me; and to
the importance with which they treated the
matter, I answered, laughing, "So Madame la
Baronne de Sta&euml;l is then a supreme power?"</p>

<p>"Indeed she is, and it might have very unfavorable
effects did your royal highness overlook
her: for what she asserts, every one believes,
and then&mdash;she has suffered <i>so</i> much!"</p>

<p>"Very likely; but what did she make my
poor sister-in-law the queen suffer? Do you
think I can forget the abominable things she
said, the falsehoods she told? and was it not
in consequence of them, and the public's belief
of them, that she owed the possibility of the
embassadress of Sweden's being able to dare
insult that unfortunate princess in her very
palace?"</p>

<p>Madame de Sta&euml;l's envoys, who manifested
some confusion at the fidelity of my memory,
implored me to forget the past, think only of the
future, and remember that the genius of Madame
de Sta&euml;l, whose reputation was European, might
be of the utmost advantage, or the reverse.
Tired of disputing I yielded; consented to receive
this <i>femme c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, as they all called her,
and fixed for her reception the same day I had
notified to Madame de Genlis.</p>

<p>My brother has said, "Punctuality is the
politeness of kings"&mdash;words as true and just as
they are happily expressed; and the princes of
my family have never been found wanting in
good manners; so I was in my study waiting
when Madame de Genlis was announced. I
was astonished at the sight of a long, dry
woman, with a swarthy complexion, dressed in
a printed cotton gown, any thing but clean, and
a shawl covered with dust, her habit-shirt, her
hair even, bearing marks of great negligence.
I had read her works, and remembering all she
said about neatness, and cleanliness, and proper
attention to one's dress, I thought she added
another to the many who fail to add example to
their precepts. While making these reflections,
Madame de Genlis was firing off a volley of
courtesies; and upon finishing what she deemed
the requisite number, she pulled out of a great
huge bag four manuscripts of enormous dimensions.</p>

<p>"I bring," commenced the lady, "to your
royal highness what will amply repay any kindness
you may show to me&mdash;No. 1 is a plan of
conduct, and the project of a constitution; No.
2 contains a collection of speeches in answer to
those likely to be addressed to Monsieur; No. 3,
addresses and letters proper to send to foreign
powers, the provinces, &amp;c.; and in No. 4 Monsieur
will find a plan of education, the only one
proper to be pursued by royalty, in reading
which, your royal highness will feel as convinced
of the extent of my acquirements as of the purity
of my loyalty."</p>

<p>Many in my place might have been angry;
but, on the contrary, I thanked her with an air
of polite sincerity for the treasures she was so
obliging as to confide to me, and then condoled
with her upon the misfortunes she had endured
under the tyranny of Bonaparte.</p>

<p>"Alas! Monsieur, this abominable despot
dared to make a mere plaything of <i>me</i>! and yet I
strove, by wise advice, to guide him right, and
teach him to regulate his conduct properly: but
he would not be led. I even offered to mediate
between him and the Pope, but he did not so
much as answer me upon this subject; although
(being a most profound theologian) I could have
smoothed almost all difficulties when the Concordat
was in question."</p>

<p>This last piece of pretension was almost too
much for my gravity. However, I applauded
the zeal of this new mother of the church, and
was going to put an end to the interview, when
it came into my head to ask her if she was well
acquainted with Madame de Sta&euml;l.</p>

<p>"God forbid!" cried she, making a sign of
the cross: "I have no acquaintance with <i>such
people</i>; and I but do my duty in warning those
who have not perused the works of that lady,
to bear in mind that they are written in the
worst possible taste, and are also extremely
immoral. Let your royal highness turn your
thoughts from such books; you will find in
<i>mine</i> all that is necessary to know. I suppose
monsieur has not yet seen <i>Little Necker</i>?"</p>

<p>"Madame la Baronne de Sta&euml;l Holstein has
asked for an audience, and I even suspect she
may be already arrived at the Tuileries."</p>

<p>"Let your royal highness beware of this
woman! See in her the implacable enemy of
the Bourbons, and in me their most devoted
slave!"</p>

<p>This new proof of the want of memory in
Madame de Genlis amused me as much as the
other absurdities she had favored me with; and
I was in the act of making her the ordinary
salutations of adieu, when I observed her blush
purple, and her proud rival entered.</p>

<p>The two ladies exchanged a haughty bow, and
the comedy, which had just finished with the
departure of Madame de Genlis, recommenced
under a different form when Madame de Sta&euml;l
appeared on the stage. The baroness was
dressed, not certainly dirtily, like the countess,
but quite as absurdly. She wore a red satin
gown, embroidered with flowers of gold and
silk; a profusion of diamonds; rings enough to
stock a pawnbroker's shop; and, I must add,
that I never before saw so low a cut corsage
display less inviting charms. Upon her head
was a huge turban, constructed on the pattern
of that worn by the Cumean sibyl, which put a
finishing stroke to a costume so little in harmony
with her style of face. I scarcely understand
how a woman of genius <i>can</i> have such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
false, vulgar taste. Madame de Sta&euml;l began
by apologizing for occupying a few moments
which she doubted not I should have preferred
giving to Madame de Genlis. "She is one of
the illustrations of the day," observed she with
a sneering smile&mdash;"a colossus of religious faith,
and represents in her person, she fancies, all the
literature of the age. Ah, ah, monsieur, in the
hands of <i>such people</i> the world would soon retrograde;
while it should, on the contrary, be
impelled forward, and your royal highness be
the first to put yourself at the head of this
great movement. To you should belong the
glory of giving the impulse, guided by <i>my
experience</i>."</p>

<p>"Come," thought I, "here is another going
to plague me with plans of conduct, and constitutions,
and reforms, which I am to persuade
the king my brother to adopt. It seems to be
an insanity in France this composing of new
constitutions." While I was making these reflections,
madame had time to give utterance
to a thousand fine phrases, every one more
sublime than the preceding. However, to put
an end to them, I asked her if there was any
thing she wished to demand.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear!&mdash;oh yes, prince!" replied the
lady in an indifferent tone. "A mere trifle&mdash;less
than nothing&mdash;two millions, without counting
the interest at five per cent.; but these are
matters I leave entirely to my men of business,
being for my own part much more absorbed in
politics and the science of government."</p>

<p>"Alas! madame, the king has arrived in
France with his mind made up upon most subjects,
the fruit of twenty-five years' meditation;
and I fear he is not likely to profit by your good
intentions!"</p>

<p>"Then so much the worse for him and for
France! All the world knows what it cost
Bonaparte his refusing to follow my advice,
and pay me my two millions. I have studied
the Revolution profoundly, followed it through
all its phases, and I flatter myself I am the
only pilot who can hold with one hand the rudder
of the state, if at least I have Benjamin for
steersman."</p>

<p>"Benjamin! Benjamin&mdash;who?" asked I, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"It would give me the deepest distress,"
replied she, "to think that the name of M. le
Baron de Rebecque Benjamin de Constant has
never reached the ears of your royal highness.
One of his ancestors saved the life of Henri
Quatre. Devoted to the descendants of this
good king, he is ready to serve them; and
among several <i>constitutions</i> he has in his portfolio,
you will probably find one with annotations
and reflections by myself, which will suit
you. Adopt it, and choose Benjamin Constant
to carry out the idea."</p>

<p>It seemed like a thing resolved&mdash;an event
decided upon&mdash;this proposal of inventing a constitution
for us. I kept as long as I could upon
the defensive; but Madame de Sta&euml;l, carried
away by her zeal and enthusiasm, instead of
speaking of what personally concerned herself,
knocked me about with arguments, and crushed
me under threats and menaces; so, tired to
death of entertaining, instead of a clever, humble
woman, a roaring politician in petticoats, I
finished the audience, leaving her as little satisfied
as myself with the interview. Madame de
Genlis was ten times less disagreeable, and
twenty times more amusing.</p>

<p>That same evening I had M. le Prince de
Talleyrand with me, and I was confounded by
hearing him say, "So your royal highness has
made Madame de Sta&euml;l completely quarrel with
me now?"</p>

<p>"Me! I never so much as pronounced your
name."</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding that, she is convinced that
I am the person who prevents your royal highness
from employing her in your political relations,
and that I am jealous of Benjamin Constant.
She is resolved on revenge."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha&mdash;and what can she do?"</p>

<p>"A very great deal of mischief, monseigneur.
She has numerous partisans; and if she declares
herself Bonapartiste, we must look to
ourselves."</p>

<p>"That <i>would</i> be curious."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall take upon myself to prevent her
going so far; but she will be Royalist no longer,
and we shall suffer from that."</p>

<p>At this time I had not the remotest idea
what a mere man, still less a mere woman,
could do in France; but now I understand it
perfectly, and if Madame de Sta&euml;l was living&mdash;Heaven
pardon me!&mdash;I would strike up a
flirtation with her.</p>

<h2>THE TWO ROADS.</h2>


<p>It was New-Year's night. An aged man was
standing at a window. He raised his mournful
eyes toward the deep-blue sky, where the
stars were floating, like white lilies, on the surface
of a clear, calm lake. Then he cast them
on the earth, where few more hopeless beings
than himself now moved toward their certain
goal&mdash;the tomb. Already he had passed sixty
of the stages which lead to it, and he had
brought from his journey nothing but errors and
remorse. His health was destroyed, his mind
vacant, his heart sorrowful, and his old age devoid
of comfort. The days of his youth rose
up in a vision before him, and he recalled the
solemn moment, when his father had placed
him at the entrance of two roads, one leading
into a peaceful, sunny land, covered with a fertile
harvest, and resounding with soft, sweet
songs; while the other conducted the wanderer
into a deep, dark cave, whence there was no
issue, where poison flowed instead of water, and
where serpents hissed and crawled.</p>

<p>He looked toward the sky, and cried out in
his agony, "O youth, return! O my father,
place me once more at the entrance to life, that
I may choose the better way!"</p>

<p>But the days of his youth and his father had
both passed away. He saw wandering lights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
floating far away over dark marshes, and then
disappear&mdash;these were the days of his wasted
life. He saw a star fall from heaven, and vanish
in darkness. This was an emblem of himself;
and the sharp arrows of unavailing remorse
struck home to his heart. Then he remembered
his early companions, who entered
on life with him, but who, having trod the
paths of virtue and of labor, were now happy
and honored on this New-Year's night. The
clock in the high church tower struck, and the
sound, falling on his ear, recalled his parents'
early love for him, their erring son; the lessons
they had taught him; the prayers they had
offered up on his behalf. Overwhelmed with
shame and grief, he dared no longer look toward
that heaven where his father dwelt; his darkened
eyes dropped tears, and, with one despairing
effort, he cried aloud, "Come back, my early
days! come back!"</p>

<p>And his youth <i>did</i> return; for all this was
but a dream which visited his slumbers on New-Year's
night. He was still young; his faults
alone were real. He thanked God, fervently,
that time was still his own, that he had not
yet entered the deep, dark cavern, but that he
was free to tread the road leading to the peaceful
land, where sunny harvests wave.</p>

<p>Ye who still linger on the threshold of life,
doubting which path to choose, remember that,
when years are passed, and your feet stumble
on the dark mountain, you will cry bitterly, but
cry in vain: "O youth, return! O give me back
my early days!"</p>

<h2>STORIES OF SHIPWRECK.</h2>


<p>The Magpie, commanded by Lieutenant Edward
Smith, was lost during a hurricane in
the West Indies, in 1826. At the moment of
the vessel going down, a gunner's mate of the
name of Meldrum struck out and succeeded in
reaching a pair of oars that were floating in the
water; to these he clung, and, having divested
himself of a part of his clothing, he awaited, in
dreadful anxiety, the fate of his companions.
Not a sound met his ear; in vain his anxious
gaze endeavored to pierce the gloom, but the
darkness was too intense. Minutes appeared
like hours, and still the awful silence remained
unbroken: he felt, and the thought was agony,
that, out of the twenty-four human beings who
had so lately trod the deck of the schooner, he
alone was left. This terrible suspense became
almost beyond the power of endurance; and he
already began to envy the fate of his companions,
when he heard a voice at no great distance
inquiring if there was any one near. He answered
in the affirmative; and, pushing out in
the direction from whence the sound proceeded,
he reached a boat to which seven persons were
clinging; among whom was Lieutenant Smith,
the commander of the sloop. So far, this was
a subject of congratulation; he was no longer
alone; but yet the chances of his ultimate preservation
were as distant as ever. The boat,
which had been placed on the booms of the
schooner, had, fortunately, escaped clear of the
sinking vessel, and, if the men had waited patiently,
was large enough to have saved them
all; but the suddenness of the calamity had
deprived them of both thought and prudence.
Several men had attempted to climb in on one
side; the consequence was, the boat heeled over,
became half filled with water, and then turned
keel uppermost; and, when Meldrum reached
her, he found some stretched across the keel,
and others hanging on by the sides.</p>

<p>Matters could not last long in this way; and
Mr. Smith, seeing the impossibility of any of
the party being saved if they continued in their
present position, endeavored to bring them to
reason, by pointing out the absurdity of their
conduct. To the honor of the men, they listened
with the same respect to their commander as
if they had been on board the schooner; those
on the keel immediately relinquished their hold,
and succeeded, with the assistance of their comrades,
in righting the boat. Two of their number
got into her, and commenced baling with
their hats, while the others remained in the
water, supporting themselves by the gunwales.</p>

<p>Order being restored, their spirits began to
revive, and they entertained hopes of escaping
from their present peril: but this was of short
duration; and the sufferings which they had as
yet endured were nothing in comparison with
what they had now to undergo. The two men
had scarcely commenced baling, when a cry was
heard of "A shark! a shark!" No words can
describe the consternation which ensued; it is
well known the horror sailors have of these voracious
animals, who seem apprised, by instinct,
when their prey is at hand. All order was at
an end; the boat again capsized, and the men
were left struggling in the waters. The general
safety was neglected, and it was every man for
himself; no sooner had one got hold of the boat
than he was pushed away by another, and in
this fruitless contest more than one life was
nearly sacrificed. Even in this terrible hour,
their commander remained cool and collected;
his voice was still raised in words of encouragement,
and, as the dreaded enemy did not make
its appearance, he again succeeded in persuading
them to renew their efforts to clear the boat.
The night had passed away&mdash;It was about ten
o'clock on the morning of the 28th: the baling
had progressed without interruption; a little
more exertion, and the boat would have been
cleared, when again was heard the cry of "The
sharks! the sharks!" But this was no false
alarm; the boat a second time capsized, and the
unhappy men were literally cast among a shoal
of these terrible monsters. The men, for a few
minutes, remained uninjured, but not untouched,
for the sharks actually rubbed against their
victims, and, to use the exact words of one of
the survivors, "frequently passed over the boat
and between us while resting on the gunwale."
This, however, did not last long; a shriek soon
told the fate of one of the men: a shark had
seized him by the leg, dyeing the water with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
his blood; another shriek followed, and another
man disappeared.</p>

<p>But these facts are almost too horrible to
dwell upon; human nature revolts from so terrible
a picture; we will, therefore, hurry over
this part of our tale.</p>

<p>Smith had witnessed the sufferings of his followers
with the deepest distress; and, although
aware that, in all probability, he must soon
share the same fate, he never for a moment
appeared to think of himself. There were but
six men left; and these he endeavored to sustain
by his example, cheering them on to further
exertions. They had, once more, recommenced
their labors to clear out the boat, when
one of his legs was seized by a shark. Even
while suffering the most horrible torture, he restrained
the expression of his feelings, for fear
of increasing the alarm of the men; but the
powers of his endurance were doomed to be
tried to the utmost; another limb was scrunched
from his body, and, uttering a deep groan,
he was about to let go his hold, when he was
seized by two of his men, and placed in the
stern-sheets.</p>

<p>Yet, when his whole frame was convulsed
with agony, the energies of his mind remained
as strong as ever; his own pain was disregarded;
he thought only of the preservation of his crew.
Calling to his side a lad of the name of Wilson,
who appeared the strongest of the remaining
few, he exhorted him, in the event of his surviving,
to inform the admiral that he was going
to Cape Ontario, in search of the pirate,
when the unfortunate accident occurred. "Tell
him," he continued, "that my men have done
their duty, and that no blame is attached to
them. I have but one favor to ask, and that
is, that he will promote Meldrum to be a gunner."</p>

<p>He then shook each man by the hand, and
bade them farewell. By degrees his strength
began to fail, and at last became so exhausted
that he was unable to speak. He remained in
this state until the sun set, when another panic
seized the men from a re-appearance of the
sharks; the boat gave a lurch, and the gallant
commander found an end to his sufferings in a
watery grave.</p>

<p>The Anson was lost, in 1807, off the coast
of France. The ship was no longer an object
of consideration; Captain Lydiard felt that he
had done his utmost to save her, but in vain,
and that now every energy must be put forth for
the preservation of human life. The tempest
raged with such fury, that no boat could possibly
come to their aid, nor could the strongest
swimmer hope to gain the shore. It appeared
to Captain Lydiard, that the only chance of
escape for any of the crew was in running the
ship as near the coast as possible. He gave the
necessary orders, and the master ran the vessel
on the sand which forms the bar between the
Loe Pool and the sea, about three miles from
Helstone. The tide had been ebbing nearly an
hour when she took the ground, and she broached
to, leaving her broadside heeling over, and
facing the beach.</p>

<p>The scene of horror and confusion which ensued,
on the Anson striking against the ground,
was one which baffles all description. Many
of the men were washed away by the tremendous
sea which swept over the deck; many
others were killed by the falling of the spars,
the crashing sound of which, as they fell from
aloft, mingled with the shrieks of the women
on board, was heard even amidst the roar of
the waters and the howling of the winds. The
coast was lined with crowds of spectators, who
watched with an intense and painful interest
the gradual approach of the ill-fated vessel toward
the shore, and witnessed the subsequent
melancholy catastrophe.</p>

<p>Calm and undaunted amidst the terrors of
the scene, Captain Lydiard is described as displaying,
in a remarkable degree, that self-possession
and passive heroism which has been so
often the proud characteristic of the commander
of a British ship-of-war under similar harassing
circumstances. Notwithstanding the confusion
of the scene, his voice was heard, and his orders
were obeyed with that habitual deference which,
even in danger and in death, an English seaman
rarely fails to accord to his commanding
officer. He was the first to restore order, to
assist the wounded, to encourage the timid, and
to revive expiring hope. Most providentially,
when the vessel struck, the mainmast, in falling
overboard, served to form a communication
between the ship and the shore, and Captain
Lydiard was the first to point out this circumstance
to the crew. Clinging with his arm to
the wheel of the rudder, in order to prevent his
being washed overboard by the waves, he continued
to encourage one after another as they
made the perilous attempt to reach the shore.
It was fated that this gallant officer should not
enjoy in this world the reward of his humanity
and his heroism. After watching with thankfulness
the escape of many of his men, and
having seen, with horror, many others washed
off the mast, in their attempts to reach the
land, he was about to undertake the dangerous
passage himself, when he was attracted by the
cries of a person seemingly in an agony of terror.
The brave man did not hesitate for a moment,
but turned and made his way to the
place whence the cries proceeded. There he
found a boy, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his own, whom he
had entered on board the Anson only a few
months before, clinging, in despair to a part of
the wreck, and without either strength or courage
to make the least effort for his own preservation.
Captain Lydiard's resolution was instantly
taken: he would save the lad if possible,
though he might himself perish in the attempt.
He threw one arm round the boy, while
he cheered him by words of kind encouragement;
with the other arm, he clung to the spars and
mast to support himself and his burden. But
the struggle did not last long; nature was exhausted
by the mental and physical sufferings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
he had endured; he lost his hold, not of the
boy, but of the mast, the wild waves swept
over them, and they perished together.</p>

<h2>JOE SMITH AND THE MORMONS.</h2>

<h3>BY PROF. JAMES F.W. JOHNSTON.</h3>


<p>In the future history of mankind, if present
appearances are to be trusted, the counties
of Wayne and Ontario, N.Y., are likely to derive
an interest and importance, in the eyes of a
numerous body of people, from a circumstance
wholly unconnected either with their social progress,
or with their natural productions or capabilities.
In these counties lie the scenes of the
early passages in the life of Joe Smith, the
founder of the sect of the Mormons.</p>

<p>Born in December, 1805, in Sharon, Windsor
County, State of Vermont, he removed with his
father, about 1815, to a small farm in Palmyra,
Wayne County, New York, and assisted him on
the farm till 1826. He received little education,
read indifferently, wrote and spelt badly,
knew little of arithmetic, and, in all other
branches of learning he was, to the day of his
death, exceedingly ignorant.</p>

<p>His own account of his religious progress is,
that as early as fifteen years of age he began to
have serious ideas regarding the future state,
that he got into occasional ecstasies, and that
in 1823, during one of these ecstasies, he was
visited by an angel, who told him that his sins
were forgiven&mdash;that the time was at hand when
the gospel in its fullness was to be preached to
all nations&mdash;that the American Indians were a
remnant of Israel, who, when they first emigrated
to America, were an enlightened people,
possessing a knowledge of the true God, and enjoying
his favor&mdash;that the prophets and inspired
writers among them had kept a history or record
of their proceedings&mdash;that these records were
safely deposited&mdash;and that, if faithful, he was
to be the favored instrument for bringing them
to light.</p>

<p>On the following day, according to instructions
from the angel, he went to a hill which he calls
Cumorah, in Palmyra township, Wayne County,
and there, in a stone chest, after a little digging,
he saw the records; but it was not till four
years after, in September 1827, that "the
angel of the Lord delivered the records into his
hands."</p>

<p>"These records were engraved on plates
which had the appearance of gold, were seven
by eight inches in size, and thinner than common
tin, and were covered on both sides with
Egyptian characters, small and beautifully engraved.
They were bound together in a volume
like the leaves of a book, and were fastened at
one edge with three rings running through the
whole. The volume was about six inches in
thickness, bore many marks of antiquity, and
part of it was sealed. With the records was
found a curious instrument, called by the
ancients Urim and Thummim, which consisted
of two transparent stones, clear as crystal, and
set in two rims of a bow"&mdash;a pair of pebble
spectacles, in other words, or "helps to read"
unknown tongues.</p>

<p>The report of his discovery having got abroad,
his house was beset, he was mobbed, and his
life was endangered by persons who wished to
possess themselves of the plates. He therefore
packed up his goods, concealed the plates <i>in a
barrel of beans</i>, and proceeded across the country
to the northern part of Pennsylvania, near the
Susquehannah river, where his father-in-law resided.
Here, "by the gift and power of God,
through the means of the Urim and Thummim,
he began to translate the record, and, being a
poor writer, he employed a scribe to write the
translation as it came from his mouth." In
1830 a large edition of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>
was published. It professes to be an abridgment
of the records made by the prophet Mormon, of
the people of the Nephites, and left to his son
Moroni to finish. It is regarded by the Latter-day
Saints with the same veneration as the
New Testament is among Christians.</p>

<p>The Church of the Latter-day Saints was
organized on the 6th of April, 1830, at Manchester,
in Ontario County, New York. Its
numbers at first were few, but they rapidly increased,
and in 1833 removed to the State of
Missouri, and purchased a large tract of land in
Jackson County. Here their neighbors tarred
and feathered some, killed others, and compelled
the whole to remove. They then established
themselves in Clay County, in the same State,
but on the opposite side of the river. From this
place again, in 1835, they removed eastward to
the State of Ohio, settled at Kirtland, in Geauga
County, about twenty miles from Cleveland,
and began to build a temple, upon which sixty-thousand
dollars were expended. At Kirtland
a bank was incorporated by Joe and his friends,
property was bought with its notes, and settled
upon the Saints, after which the bank failed&mdash;as
many others did about the same time&mdash;and
Ohio became too hot for the Mormons. Again,
therefore, the Prophet, his apostles, and a great
body of the Saints, left their home and temple,
went westward a second time to the State of
Missouri, purchased a large tract of land in
Caldwell County, in Missouri, and built the city
of the "Far West." Here difficulties soon beset
them, and in August, 1838, became so serious
that the military were called in; and the Mormons
were finally driven, unjustly, harshly, and
oppressively, by force of arms, from the State of
Missouri, and sought protection in the State of
Illinois, on the eastern bank of the Mississippi.
They were well received in this State, and after
wandering for some time&mdash;while their leader,
Joe Smith, was in jail&mdash;they bought a beautiful
tract of land in Hancock County, and, in the
spring of 1840, began to build the city and
temple of Nauvoo. The Legislature of Illinois
at first passed an act giving great, and, probably,
injudicious privileges to this city, which, in
1844, was already the largest in the State, and
contained a population of about twenty thousand
souls. The temple, too, was of great size and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
magnificence&mdash;being 128 feet long and 77 feet
high, and stood on an elevated situation, from
which it was visible to a distance of 25 or 30
miles. In the interior was an immense baptismal
font, in imitation of the brazen sea of
Solomon&mdash;"a stone reservoir, resting upon the
backs of twelve oxen, also cut out of stone, and
as large as life."</p>

<p>But persecution followed them to Illinois,
provoked in some degree, no doubt, by their own
behavior, especially in making and carrying into
effect city ordinances, which were contrary to
the laws of the State. The people of the adjoining
townships rose in arms, and were joined
by numbers of the old enemies of the Mormons
from Missouri. The militia were called out;
and, to prevent further evils, Joe Smith and
one of his brothers, with several other influential
Saints, on an assurance of safety and protection
from the Governor of the State, were induced to
surrender themselves for trial in respect of the
charges brought against them, and were conducted
to prison. Here they were inconsiderately
left by the Governor, on the following day,
under a guard of seven or eight men. These
were overpowered the same afternoon by an
armed mob, who killed Joe Smith and his
brother, and then made their escape. After
this, the Mormons remained a short time longer
in the Holy City; but the wound was too deep
seated to admit of permanent quiet on either
part, and they were at last driven out by force,
and compelled to abandon or sacrifice their
property. Such as escaped this last persecution,
after traversing the boundless prairies, the
deserts of the Far West, and the Rocky Mountains,
appear at last to have found a resting-place
near the Great Salt Lake in Oregon.
They are increasing faster since this last catastrophe
than ever; and are daily receiving large
accessions of new members from Europe, especially
from Great Britain. They form the
nucleus of the new State of Utah, this year
erected into a Territory of the United States,
and likely, in the next session of Congress, to be
elevated to the dignity of an independent State.
So rapidly has persecution helped on this offspring
of ignorance, and tended to give a permanent
establishment, and a bright future, to a system,
not simply of pure invention, but of blasphemous
impiety, and folly the most insane.</p>

<p>The <i>Book of Mormon</i>, which is the written
guide of this new sect, consists of a series of
professedly historical books&mdash;a desultory and
feeble imitation of the Jewish chronicles and
prophetical books&mdash;in which, for the poetry and
warnings of the ancient prophets, are substituted
a succession of unconnected rhapsodies and
repetitions such as might form the perorations
of ranting addresses by a field preacher, to a
very ignorant audience.</p>

<p>The book, in the edition I possess, consists
in all of 634 pages, of which the first 580 contain
the history of a fictitious personage called
Lehi and that of his descendants for the space
of a thousand years.</p>

<p>This Lehi, a descendant of Joseph the son
of Jacob, with his family left Jerusalem in the
beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, six hundred
years before Christ, and, passing the Red Sea,
journeyed eastward for eight years till they
reached the shore of a wide sea. There they
built a ship, and, embarking, were carried at
length to the promised land, where they settled
and multiplied. Among the sons of Lehi one
was called Laman and another Nephi. The
former was wicked, and a disbeliever in the law
of Moses and the prophets; the latter, obedient
and faithful, and a believer in the coming of
Christ. Under the leadership of these two opposing
brothers, the rest of the family and their
descendants arranged themselves, forming the
Lamanites and the Nephites, between whom
wars and perpetual hostilities arose. The
Lamanites were idle hunters, living in tents,
eating raw flesh, and having only a girdle round
their loins. The skin of Laman and his followers
became black; while that of Nephi and his
people, who tilled the land, retained its original
whiteness. As with the Jews, the Nephites
were successful when they were obedient to the
law; and, when they fell away to disobedience
and wickedness, the Lamanites had the better,
and put many to death. At the end of about
four hundred years, a portion of the righteous
Nephites under Mosiah, having left their land,
traveled far across the wilderness, and discovered
the city of Zarahemla, which was peopled by
the descendants of a colony of Jews who had
wandered from Jerusalem when King Zedekiah
was carried away captive to Babylon, twelve
years after the emigration of Lehi. But they
were heathens, possessed no copy of the law,
and had corrupted their language. They received
the Nephites warmly, however, learned
their language, and gladly accepted the law of
Moses.</p>

<p>This occupies 158 pages. The history of the
next two hundred years follows this new people,
and that of occasional converts from the Lamanites&mdash;called
still by the general name of Nephites
in their struggles with the Lamanites, and
the alternations of defeat and success which
accompany disobedience or the contrary. This
occupies several books, and brings us to the
486th page, and the period of the birth of
Christ. This event is signified to the people of
Zarahemla by a great light, which made the
night as light as mid-day. And thirty-three
years after there was darkness for three days,
and thunderings and earthquakes, and the destruction
of cities and people. This was a sign
of the crucifixion. Soon after this, Christ himself
appears to this people of Zarahemla in
America, repeats to them in long addresses the
substance of his numerous sayings and discourses,
as recorded by the apostles; chooses twelve to
go forth and preach and baptize; and then disappears.
On occasion of a great baptizing by
the apostles, however, he appears again; imparts
the Holy Spirit to all, makes long discourses,
and disappears. And, finally, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
apostles themselves he appears a third time;
and addresses them in ill-assorted extracts and
paraphrases of his New Testament sayings.</p>

<p>The account of these visits of our Saviour to
the American Nephites, and of his sayings, occupies
about 48 pages. For about 400 years,
the Christian doctrine and church thus planted
among the Nephites had various fortune; increasing
at first, and prospering, but, as corruptions
came in, encountering adversity. The
Lamanites were still their fierce enemies; and
as wickedness and corrupt doctrine began to
prevail among the Christians, the Lamanites
gained more advantages. It would appear, from
Joe Smith's descriptions, that he means the
war to have begun at the Isthmus of Darien&mdash;where
the Nephites were settled, and occupied
the country to the north, while the Lamanites
lived south of the isthmus. From the isthmus
the Nephites were gradually driven toward the
east, till finally, at the hill of Cumorah, near
Palmyra, in Wayne County, western New York,
the last battle was fought, in which, with the
loss of 230,000 fighting men, the Nephites were
exterminated! Among the very few survivors
was Moroni the last of the scribes, who deposited
in this hill the metal plates which the
virtuous Joe Smith was selected to receive from
the hands of the angel. This occupies to the
580th page.</p>

<p>But now, in the Book of Ether, which follows,
Joe becomes more bold, and goes back to the
tower of Babel for another tribe of fair people,
whom he brings over and settles in America.
At the confusion of the languages, Ether and
his brethren journeyed to the great sea, and,
after a sojourn of four years on the shore, built
boats under the Divine direction, water-tight,
and covered over like walnuts, with a bright
stone in each end to give light! And when
they had embarked in their tight boats, a strong
wind arose, blowing toward the promised land,
and for 344 days it blew them along the water,
till they arrived safe at the shore. Here, like
the sons of Lehi, they increased and prospered,
and had kings and prophets and wars, and were
split into parties, who fought with each other.
Finally, Shiz rose in rebellion against Coriantumr,
the last king, and they fought with alternate
success, till two millions of mighty men, with
their wives and children, had been slain! And,
after this, all the people were gathered either
on the one side or the other, and fought for
many days, till only Coriantumr alone remained
alive!</p>

<p>This foolish history is written with the professedly
religious purpose of showing the punishment
from the hand of God which wicked behavior
certainly entails; and, with some trifling
moralities of Moroni, completes the <i>Book of
Mormon</i>.</p>

<p>Joseph Smith does not affect in this gospel
of his to bring in any new doctrine, or to supersede
the Bible, but to restore "many plain and
precious things which have been taken away
from the first book by the abominable church, the
Mother of Harlots." It is full of sillinesses,
follies, and anachronisms; but I have not discovered,
in my cursory review, any of the
immoralities or positive licentiousness which
he himself practiced, directly inculcated. He
teaches faith in Christ, human depravity, the
power of the Holy Ghost, the doctrine of the
Trinity, of the atonement, and of salvation only
through Christ. He recommends the sacraments
of baptism and the Lord's Supper; and, whatever
his own conduct and that of his people
may be, certainly in his book prohibits polygamy
and priestcraft.</p>

<p>The wickedness of his book consists in its
being a lie from beginning to end, and of himself
in being throughout an impostor. Pretending
to be a "seer"&mdash;which, he says, is greater
than a prophet&mdash;he puts into the hands of his
followers a work of pure invention as a religious
guide inspired by God, and which, among his
followers, is to take the place of the Bible.
Though an ignorant man, he was possessed of
much shrewdness. He courted persecution,
though he hoped to profit, not to die by it.
Unfortunately, his enemies, by their inconsiderate
persecution, have made him a martyr
for his opinions, and have given a stability to
his sect which nothing may now be able to
shake. It was urged by Smith himself that the
New World was as deserving of a direct revelation
as the Old; and his disciples press upon
their hearers that, as an <i>American revelation</i>,
this system has peculiar claims upon their regard
and acceptance. The feeling of nationality
being thus connected with the new sect, weak-minded
native-born Americans might be swayed
by patriotic motives in connecting themselves
with it. But it is mortifying to learn that most
numerous accessions are being made to the body
in their new home by converts proceeding from
England.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Under the name of the "Latter-day
Saints," professing the doctrines of the
gospel, the delusions of the system are hidden
from the masses by the emissaries who have
been dispatched into various countries to recruit
their numbers among the ignorant and devoutly-inclined
lovers of novelty. Who can tell what
two centuries may do in the way of giving a
historical position to this rising heresy?</p>

<h2>AN ICE-HILL PARTY IN RUSSIA.</h2>


<p>The reader, I hope, will have no objection to
quit his comfortable fire-side, put on his furs,
and accompany me to a sledge, or ice-hill party.</p>

<p>An army of about ten or fifteen sledges start
from a house where all the party assemble, the
gentlemen driving themselves, and each family
taking some provisions with them. After about
an hour and three-quarters' drive, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
caravan arrives at the house of a <i>starosto</i> (president)
of the work-people employed by the foreign
commercial houses in Russia. The <i>starosto</i>
is usually a wealthy man, and mostly looked up
to by his neighbors, as he has by some most extraordinary
means acquired some few townish
manners, which suit <i>his</i> country appearance as
much as glazed boots, and a polka tie would
suit the true English country farmer.</p>

<p>After having warmed themselves before a
good hot Russian stove, the party begin operations
by getting the sledges ready, and ascending
the ice-hills. The hills are made of a wooden
scaffold, covered with huge bits of ice, all of
an equal size, placed side-by-side, so as to fit
closely together. By being constantly watered,
they gradually become one solid mass, as smooth
as a mirror. The hill, which usually is of a considerable
height, and rather sloping, ends in a
long, narrow plain of ice called the run, which
is just broad enough for three narrow sledges to
pass each other, and long enough to carry you
to the foot of a second hill.</p>

<p>The sledges are usually of iron, long and
narrow, and covered by cushions, often embroidered
by the fair hand of a lady. They are
low, and so constructed that they can hold one
or two persons, as the case may be. Both the
run and the hill are bordered by fir trees on
each side, and on such evening parties are illuminated
with Chinese lamps placed between
the branches of the trees. Fancy yourself on
the top of the hill looking down this illuminated
avenue of firs, which is reflected in the mirror
of the ice, as if determining to outshine the
lights in the clear sky, and the gay laughing
crowds moving up and down the hills, and you
have before you the finest and most perfect picture
of sorrowless enjoyment, as a striking contrast
to the lifeless nature surrounding it. The
briskness of the movement, and the many accidents
happening to the clumsy members of the
party, keep up the excitement, while the contest
of young men to obtain this or the other lady
for their partner on their down-hill journey (not
in life), never allows the conversation or the
laugh to flag for one moment. I remember once
getting into what school-boys would call an
awful scrape with one of the ice-hill heroes.
We both started together from the second hill
on a race, and I, having a faster sledge, overtook
him by the length of my conveyance, and
arrived at the top of the hill before him. Seeing
that the <i>belle</i> of the evening was disengaged,
I approached her with all the formality with
which the newly-admitted youth requests the
queen of a ball-room for the pleasure and honor
to dance a polka with her, and asked her to go
down. Forgetting a previous appointment with
my former antagonist, she accepted my offer,
and the latter just arrived in time to see us
start from the hill. In his rage he determined
to do me some mischief by upsetting my sledge,
as soon as he had an opportunity of doing so
without any damage to another party. He soon
had an occasion, but, unfortunately I had a
sledge with a lady before me; passing me, he
hit me, and I, hitting against the sledge before
me, without being able to avoid it, at the same
time getting hold of his legs, upset all three.
Luckily, no injury was done, as the whole lot
were upset into the snow, to the great enjoyment
of all spectators.</p>

<p>Gradually the time to retire approaches. The
lamps begin to go out, and the hills, divested
of their beauty, appear like the ruins of a magnificent
city of olden times. Here and there
you see a single lamp peeping out from the
branches of the trees, wistfully looking round in
search of its brothers, as if it wanted to assure
itself of the absence of any other enlightening
object.</p>

<p>The party go in to refresh themselves with
tea and other warm beverages. The gentlemen
wait on the ladies, and a new contest begins,
as each tries to surpass the other in politeness
and quickness. If it is a supper, you see these
youthful and useful members of society running
about with plates of sandwiches, or steering
along with a cup of <i>bouillon</i> in one and a glass
of wine in the other hand, through the intricate
passages formed by the numberless tables occupied
by members of the fair sex. And then
having, after a great deal of danger, at last
arrived at their destination, they find the lady
they wanted to serve already provided with
every necessary comfort; and, perchance, she
is so much engaged in conversation with their
more fortunate rival, that she can not even give
them a grateful smile for their trouble. Now
the ladies adjourn, and the field of action is left
to the gentlemen. All restraint seems to have
gone. The clatter of knives, the jingling of
glasses, the hubbub of voices, all this makes
such a chaos of strange and mysterious noises,
that it has quite a deafening effect. At last a
cry of order is heard from the top of the table.
One of the directors of the party, after having
requested the audience to fill their glasses, in
flowery language proposes the health of the ladies,
which, of course, is drunk with tremendous
applause, manifested by acts, such as beating
with the handles of knives and forks on the
table, and clapping hands.</p>

<p>After several other toasts, the party adjourn
to join the ladies. Merry-making now begins,
and an hour or so is passed in social games,
such as hunting the slipper, cross-questions,
crooked answers, and others. At last, the parties
wrap themselves up again in their furs, and
prepare to go home. On their homeward tour,
one of the finest phenomena in nature may,
perchance, appear to them. A streak of light,
suddenly appearing on the horizon, shoots like
lightning up to the sky. One moment longer,
and the whole sky is covered by such streaks,
all of different colors amalgamating together,
and constantly changing and lighting up the
objects as bright as daylight. This is the Aurora
Borealis, one of the numerous spectacles of
nature, which the common people regard with
astonishment, while the cultivated mind finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
sermon on the glory of our Maker in every object
he meets on his journey through life; looks
at it with admiration and reverence.</p>

<h2>THE BLIND LOVERS OF CHAMOUNY.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></h2>


<p>It was during a second visit to the beautiful
and melancholy valley of Chamouny that I
became acquainted with the following touching
and interesting story. A complete change of
ideas had become absolutely necessary for me;
I sought, therefore, to kindle those emotions
which must ever be awakened by the sublime
scenes of Nature; my wearied heart required
fresh excitement to divert it from the grief
which was devouring it; and the melancholy
grandeur of Chamouny seemed to present a
singular charm to my then peculiar frame of
mind.</p>

<p>Again I wandered through the graceful forest
of fir-trees, which surrounds the Village des Bois,
and, this time, with a new kind of pleasure;
once more I beheld that little plain upon which
the glaciers every now and then make an in-road,
above which the peaks of the Alps rise so
majestically, and which slopes so gently down
to the picturesque source of the Arveyron. How
I enjoyed gazing upon its portico of azure crystal,
which every year wears a new aspect. On
one occasion, when I reached this spot, I had
not proceeded very far, when I perceived that
Puck, my favorite dog, was not by my side.
How could this have happened, for he would
not have been induced to leave his master, even
for the most dainty morsel? He did not answer
to my call, and I began to feel uneasy, when,
suddenly, the pretty fellow made his appearance,
looking rather shy and uncomfortable, and
yet with caressing confidence in my affection;
his body was slightly curved, his eyes were humid
and beseeching, he carried his head very
low&mdash;so low, that his ears trailed upon the
ground, like those of Zadig's dog; Puck, too,
was a spaniel. If you had but seen Puck, in
that posture, you would have found it impossible
to be angry with him. I did not attempt
to scold him, but, nevertheless, he continued to
leave me, and return to me again; he repeated
this amusement several times; while I followed
in his track till I gradually came toward
the point of his attraction; it appeared as if a
similar kind of sympathy drew me to the same
spot.</p>

<p>Upon a projection of a rock sat a young man,
with a most touching and pleasing countenance;
he was dressed in a sort of blue blouse, in the
form of a tunic, and had a long stick of Cytisus
in his hand; his whole appearance reminded
me strongly of Poussin's antique shepherds.
His light hair clustered in thick curls round his
uncovered throat, and fell over his shoulders,
his features wore an expression of gravity, but
not of austerity, and he seemed sad, though not
desponding. There was a singular character
about his eyes, the effect of which I could
scarcely define; they were large and liquid, but
their light was quenched, and they were fixed
and unfathomable. The murmur of the wind
had disguised the sound of my footsteps, and I
soon became aware that I was not perceived.
At length, I felt sure that the young man was
blind. Puck had closely studied the emotions
which became visible in my face; but as soon
as he discovered that I was kindly disposed toward
his new friend, he jumped up to him.
The young man stroked Puck's silky coat, and
smiled good-naturedly at him.</p>

<p>"How is it that you appear to know me,"
said he, "for you do not belong to the valley?
I once had a dog as full of play as you, and,
perhaps, as pretty; but he was a French water-spaniel,
with a coat of curly wool; he has left
me, like many others&mdash;my last friend, my poor
Puck."</p>

<p>"How curious! was your dog called Puck,
too?"</p>

<p>"Ah, pardon me, sir!" exclaimed the young
man, rising, and supporting himself on his
stick. "My infirmity must excuse me."</p>

<p>"Pray sit down, my good friend; you are
blind, I fear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, blind since my infancy."</p>

<p>"Have you never been able to see?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, but for so very short a time! yet,
I have some recollection of the sun, and when I
lift up my eyes toward the point in the heavens
where it should be, I can almost fancy I see a
globe, which reminds me of its color. I have,
too, a faint remembrance of the whiteness of
the snow, and the hue of our mountains."</p>

<p>"Was it an accident which deprived you of
your sight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, an accident which was the least of
my misfortunes. I was scarcely more than two
years old, when an avalanche fell down from
the heights of La Fl&eacute;g&egrave;re, and crushed our little
dwelling. My father, who was the guide
among these mountains, had spent the evening
at the Priory; you can easily picture to yourself
his despair when he found his family swallowed
up by this horrible scourge. By the aid
of his comrades, he succeeded in making a hole
in the snow, and was thus able to get into our
cottage, the roof which was still supported on
its frail props. The first thing which met his
eyes was my cradle, he placed this at once in
safety, for the danger was rapidly increasing;
the work of the miners caused fresh masses of
ice to crumble, and served rather to hasten the
overthrow of our fragile abode; he pushed forward
to save my mother, who had fainted, and
he was afterward seen for a moment carrying
her in his arms, by the light of the torches
which burnt outside; and then all gave way.
I was an orphan, and the next day it was discovered
that my sight had been destroyed."</p>

<p>"Poor child! so you were left alone in the
world, quite alone!"</p>

<p>"In our valley, a person visited by misfortune
is never quite alone, all our good Chamouniers
united in endeavoring to relieve my
wretchedness; Balmat give me shelter, Simon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Coutet afforded me food, Gabriel Payot clothed
me; and a good widow who had lost her children,
undertook the care of me. She still performs
a mother's part to me, and guides me to
this spot every day in summer."</p>

<p>"And are these all the friends you have?"</p>

<p>"I have had more," said the young man,
while he placed his finger on his lip in a mysterious
manner; "but they are gone."</p>

<p>"Will they never come back again?"</p>

<p>"I should think not, from appearances; yet
a few days ago I imagined that Puck would
return, that he had only strayed, but nobody
strays among our glaciers with impunity. I
shall never feel him bound again at my side,
or hear him bark at the approach of travelers,"
and he brushed away a tear.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Gervais."</p>

<p>"Listen, Gervais; you must tell me about
these friends whom you have lost;" at the
same time I prepared to seat myself by his
side, but he sprang up eagerly, and took possession
of the vacant place.</p>

<p>"Not here, not here, sir; this is Eulalie's
seat, and since her departure nobody has occupied
it."</p>

<p>"Eulalie," replied I, seating myself in the
place from which he had just risen; "tell me
about Eulalie, and yourself; your story interests
me."</p>

<p>Gervais proceeded:</p>

<p>"I explained to you that my life had not
been devoid of happiness, for Heaven compensates
bountifully to those in misfortune, by inspiring
good people with pity for their wretchedness.
I lived in happy ignorance of the extent
of my deprivation; suddenly, however, a
stranger came to reside in the village des Bois,
and formed the topic of conversation in our valley.
He was only known by the name of M.
Robert, but the general opinion was, that he
was a person of distinction, who had met with
great losses, and much sorrow, and consequently
had resolved to pass his latter years in perfect
solitude. He was said to have lost a wife, to
whom he was tenderly attached; the result of
their union, a little girl, had occasioned him
much grief, for she was born blind. While the
father was held up as a model for his virtues,
the goodness and charms of his daughter were
equally extolled. My want of sight prevented
me from judging of her beauty, but could I have
beheld her she could not have left a more lovely
impression on my mind. I picture her to myself
sometimes as even more interesting than
my mother."</p>

<p>"She is dead, then?" inquired I.</p>

<p>"Dead!" replied he, in an accent in which
there was a strange mixture of terror and wild
joy! "dead! who told you so?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Gervais, I did not know her; I
was only endeavoring to find out the reason of
your separation."</p>

<p>"She is alive," said he, smiling bitterly, and
he remained silent for a moment. "I do not
know whether I told you that she was called
Eulalie. Yes, her name was Eulalie, and this
was her place;" he broke off abruptly. "Eulalie,"
repeated he, while he stretched out his
hand as if to find her by his side. Puck licked
his fingers, and looked pityingly at him: I would
not have parted from Puck for a million.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Gervais, and forgive me
for opening a wound which is scarcely yet
healed. I can guess the rest of your story.
The strange similarity of Eulalie's and your
misfortune awakened her father's interest in
you, and you became another child to him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I became another child to him, and
Eulalie was a sister to me; my kind adopted
mother and I went to take up our abode in the
new house, which is called the Chateau. Eulalie's
masters were mine; together we learned
those divine strains of harmony which raise the
soul to heaven, and together, by means of pages
printed in relief, we read with our fingers the
sublime thoughts of the philosophers, and the
beautiful creations of the poets. I endeavored
to imitate some of their graceful images, and
to paint what I had not seen. Eulalie admired
my verses, and this was all I desired.
Ah! if you had heard her sing, you would have
thought that an angel had descended to entrance
the valley. Every day in the fine season
we were conducted to this rock, which is
called by the inhabitants of this part 'le Rocher
des Aveugles;' here too the kindest of fathers
guided our steps, and bestowed on us numberless
fond attentions. Around us were tufts of
rhododendrons, beneath us was a carpet of violets
and daisies, and when our touch had recognized,
by its short stalk and its velvety disk,
the last-named flower, we amused ourselves in
stripping it of its petals, and repeated a hundred
times this innocent diversion, which served
as a kind of interpretation to our first avowal
of love."</p>

<p>As Gervais proceeded, his face acquired a
mournful expression, a cloud passed over his
brow, and he became suddenly sad and silent;
in his emotion he trod unthinkingly upon an
Alpine rose, which was, however, already withered
on its stalk; I gathered it without his
being aware of it, for I wished to preserve it in
remembrance of him. Some minutes elapsed
before Gervais seemed inclined to proceed with
his narrative, and I did not like to speak to
him; suddenly he passed his hand over his
eyes, as if to drive away a disagreeable dream,
and then turning toward me with an ingenuous
smile, he continued.</p>

<p>"Be charitable to my weakness, for I am
young, and have not yet learned to control the
emotions of my heart; some day, perhaps, I
shall be wiser."</p>

<p>"I fear, my good friend," said I, "that this
conversation is too fatiguing for you; do not
recall to your mind circumstances which appear
so painful. I shall never forgive myself
for occasioning you such an hour of grief."</p>

<p>"It is not you," replied Gervais, "who bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
back these recollections, for these thoughts are
never absent from my mind, and I would rather
that it was annihilated than that they should
ever cease to occupy it; my very existence is
mixed up with my sorrow." I had retained
Gervais's hand; he understood, therefore, that
I was listening to him.</p>

<p>"After all, my reminiscences are not entirely
made up of bitterness; sometimes I imagine
that my present affliction is only a dream&mdash;that
my real life is full of the happiness which I have
lost. I fancy that she is still near me, only,
perhaps, a little further off than usual&mdash;that
she is silent because she is plunged in deep
meditation, of which our mutual love forms a
principal part. One day we were seated as
usual on this rock, and were enjoying the
sweetness and serenity of the air, the perfume
of our violets, and the song of the birds; upon
this occasion we listened with a curious kind of
pleasure to the masses of ice which, being
loosened by the sun, shot hissingly down from
the peaks of the mountain. We could distinguish
the rushing of the waters of the Arveyron.
I do not know how it was, but we were both
suddenly impressed with a vague sensation of
the uncertainty of happiness, and at the same
time with a feeling of terror and uneasiness;
we threw ourselves into each other's arms, and
held each other tightly, as if somebody had
wished to separate us, and both of us exclaimed
eagerly, 'Ah, yes! let it be always thus, always
thus.' I felt that Eulalie scarcely breathed,
and that her overwrought state of mind required
to be soothed. 'Yes, Eulalie, let us ever
be thus to one another; the world believes that
our misfortune renders us objects only of pity,
but how can it possibly judge of the happiness
that I enjoy in your tenderness, or that you find
in mine? How little does the turmoil and
excitement of society affect us; we may be
regarded by many as imperfect beings, and this
is quite natural, for they have not yet discovered
that the perfection of happiness consists in
loving and in being loved. It is not your beauty
which has captivated me, it is something which
can not be described when felt, nor forgotten
when once experienced; it is a charm which
belongs to you alone&mdash;which I can discover in
your voice, in your mind, in every one of your
actions. Oh! if ever I enjoyed sight, I would
entreat God to extinguish the light of my eyes
in order that I might not gaze at other women&mdash;that
my thoughts might only dwell upon you.
It is you who have rendered study pleasing to
me&mdash;who have inspired me with taste for art;
if the beauties of Rossini and Weber impressed
me strongly, it was because you sang their glorious
ideas. I can well afford to dispense with
the superfluous luxuries of art, I who possess the
treasure from which it would derive its highest
price; for surely thy heart is mine, if not thou
couldst not be happy.'</p>

<p>"'I am happy,' replied Eulalie, 'the happiest
of girls.'</p>

<p>"'My dear children,' said M. Robert, while
he joined our trembling hands, 'I hope you will
always be equally happy, for it is my desire that
you should never be separated.'</p>

<p>"M. Robert was never long absent from us,
he was ever bestowing upon us marks of his
tenderness. Upon this occasion he had reached
the spot where we were seated without our having
been aware of his presence, and he had
heard us without intentionally listening. I did
not feel that I was in fault, and yet I was overwhelmed,
embarrassed. Eulalie trembled. M.
Robert placed himself between us, for we had
withdrawn a little from each other.</p>

<p>"'Why should it not be as you wish?' said
he, as he threw his arms around us, and pressed
us close together, and embraced us with more
than usual warmth. 'Why not? Am I not
sufficiently rich to procure you servants and
friends? You will have children who will replace
your poor old father; your infirmity is not
hereditary. Receive my blessing, Gervais, and
you, my Eulalie. Thank God, and dream of
to-morrow, for the day which will shine upon us
to-morrow will be beautiful even to the blind.'</p>

<p>"Eulalie embraced her father, and then
threw her arms round me; for the first time my
lips touched hers. This happiness was too great
to be called happiness. I thought that my
heart would burst; I wished to die at that moment,
but, alas! I did not die. I do not know
how happiness affects others, but mine was imperfect,
for it was without hope or calmness. I
could not sleep, or rather I did not attempt to
sleep, for it seemed to me a waste of time, and
that eternity would not be sufficiently long to
enjoy the felicity which was in store for me; I
almost regretted the past, which, though it
lacked the delicious intoxication of the present
moment, was yet free from doubts and fears.
At length I heard the household stirring; I got
up, dressed myself, performed my morning devotions,
and then went to my window, which
looked out upon the Arve. I opened it, stretched
forth my head in the morning mists to cool my
burning brow. Suddenly my door opened, and
I recognized a man's footstep; it was not M.
Robert; a hand took hold of mine&mdash;'M. Maunoir!'
exclaimed I.</p>

<p>"It was a great many years since he had
been to the Valley; but the sound of his footstep,
the touch of his hand, and something
frank and affectionate in his manner, brought
him back to my remembrance.</p>

<p>"'It is indeed he,' observed M. Maunoir, in
a faltering voice, to some one near him, 'It is
indeed my poor Gervais. You remember what
I said to you about it at that time.' He then
placed his fingers on my eyelids, and kept them
up for a few seconds. 'Ah,' said he, 'God's
will be done! You are happy at any rate, are
you not Gervais?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, very happy,' replied I. 'M. Robert
considers that I have profited by all his kindness;
I assure you I can read as well as a person
who is gifted with sight; above all, Eulalie
loves me.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"'She will love you, if possible, still more if
she should one day be able to see you.'</p>

<p>"'If she sees me, did you say?'</p>

<p>"I thought he alluded to that eternal home
where the eyes of the blind are opened, and
darkness visits them no more.</p>

<p>"My mother, as was her custom, brought
me here, but Eulalie had not arrived; she was
later than usual. I began to wonder how this
could have happened. My poor little Puck
went to meet her, but he returned to me again
without her. At length he began to bark violently,
and to jump so impatiently up and down
on the bench, that I felt sure she must be near
me, though I could not hear her myself. I
stretched myself forward in the direction she
would come, and presently my arms were clasped
in hers. M. Robert had not accompanied her
as usual, and then I began at once to feel sure
that his absence, and Eulalie's delay in reaching
our accustomed place of rendezvous, was to
be attributed to the presence of strangers at the
Chateau. You will think it very extraordinary
when I tell you that Eulalie's arrival, for which
I had so ardently longed, filled me with a restless
sensation, which had hitherto been unknown
to me. I was not at ease with Eulalie
as I had been the day before. Now that we
belonged to each other, I did not dare to make
any claim on her kindness; it seemed to me
that her father, in bestowing her on me had
imposed a thousand restrictions; I felt as if I
might not indulge in a word or caress; I was
conscious that she was more than ever mine,
and yet I did not venture to embrace her. Perhaps
she experienced the same feelings, for our
conversation was at first restrained, like that
of persons who are not much acquainted with
each other; however, this state of things could
not last long, the delicious happiness of the
past day was still fresh in our minds. I drew
near to Eulalie, and sought her eyes with my
lips, but they met a bandage.</p>

<p>"'You are hurt, Eulalie?'</p>

<p>"'A little hurt,' replied she, 'but very
slightly, since I am going to spend the day
with you, as I am in the habit of doing; and
that the only difference is, that there is a green
ribbon between your mouth and my eyes.'</p>

<p>"'Green! green! Oh, God! what does that
mean? What is a green ribbon?'</p>

<p>"'I have seen,' said she, 'I can see,' and
her hand trembled in mine, as if she had apprised
me of some fault or misfortune.</p>

<p>"'You have seen,' exclaimed I, 'you will
see! Oh! unfortunate creature that I am!
Yes, you will see, and the glass which has
hitherto been to you a cold and polished surface,
will reflect your living image; its language,
though mute, will be animated; it will
tell you each day that you are beautiful! and
when you return to me it will make you entertain
only one feeling toward me, that of pity
for my misfortunes. Yet what do I say? you
will not return to me; for who is the beautiful
girl who would bestow her affection on a blind
lover? Oh! unfortunate creature that I am
to be blind;' in my despair I fell to the earth;
she wound her arms round me, twined her fingers
in my hair, and covered me with kisses,
while she sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>"'No, no! I will never love any one but
Gervais. You were happy yesterday, in thinking
we were blind, because our love would
never be likely to change. I will be blind again,
if my recovery of sight makes you unhappy.
Shall I remove this bandage, and cause the
light of my eyes to be for ever extinguished?
Horrible idea, I had actually thought of it.'</p>

<p>"'Stop, stop,' cried I, 'our language is that
of madness, because we are both unnerved and
ill&mdash;you from excess of happiness, and I from
despair. Listen,' and I placed myself beside
her, but my heart felt ready to break. 'Listen,'
continued I, 'it is a great blessing that
you are permitted to see, for now you are perfect;
it matters not, if I do not see, or if I die;
I shall be abandoned, for this is the destiny
which God has reserved for me; but promise
me that you will never see me, that you will
never attempt to see me; if you see me, you
will, in spite of yourself, compare me to others&mdash;to
those whose soul, whose thoughts may be
read in their eyes, to those who set a woman
fondly dreaming with a single glance of fire.
I would not let it be in your power to compare
me; I would be to you what I was in the mind
of a little blind girl, as if you saw me in a
dream. I want you to promise me that you
will never come here without your green bandage;
that you will visit me every week, or
every month, or at least once every year;&mdash;ah!
promise me to come back once more, without
seeing me.'</p>

<p>"'I promise to love you always,' said Eulalie,
and she wept.</p>

<p>"I was so overcome that my senses left me,
and I fell at her feet. M. Robert lifted me
from the ground, bestowed many kind words
and embraces upon me, and placed me under
the care of my adopted mother. Eulalie was
no longer there; she came the next day, and
the day after, and several days following, and
each day my lips touched the green bandage
which kept up my delusion; I fancied I should
continue to be the same to her as long as she
did not see me. I said to myself with an insane
kind of rapture, 'my Eulalie still visits
me without seeing me; she will never see me,
and therefore I shall be always loved by her.'
One day, a little while after this, when she
came to visit me, and my lips sought her eyes
as usual, they, in wandering about, encountered
some long, silky eye-lashes beneath her green
bandage.</p>

<p>"'Ah!' exclaimed I, 'if you were likely to
see me.'</p>

<p>"'I have seen you,' said she, laughingly;
'what would have been the good of sight to
me, if I had not looked upon you? Ah! vain
fellow, who dares set limits to a woman's curiosity,
whose eyes are suddenly opened to the light?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"'But it is impossible, Eulalie, for you promised
me.'</p>

<p>"'I did not promise you any thing, dearest,
for when you asked me to make you this promise,
I had already seen you.'</p>

<p>"'You had seen me, and yet you continued
to come to me; that is well; but whom did
you see first?'</p>

<p>"'M. Maunoir, my father, Julie, then this
great world, with its trees and mountains, the
sky and the sun.'</p>

<p>"'And whom have you seen since?'</p>

<p>"'Gabriel Payot, old Balmat, the good Terraz,
the giant Cachat, and Marguerite.'</p>

<p>"'And nobody else?'</p>

<p>"'Nobody.'</p>

<p>"'How balmy the air is this evening! take off
your bandage, or you may become blind again?'</p>

<p>"'Would that grieve me so much? I tell
you again and again, that the chief happiness
I have in seeing, is to be able to look at you,
and to love you through the medium of another
sense. You were pictured in my soul as you
now are in my eyes. This faculty, which has
been restored to me, serves but as another link
to bring me closer to your heart; and this is
why I value the gift of sight.'</p>

<p>"These words I shall never forget. My days
now flowed on calmly and happily, for hope
so easily seduces; our mode of life was considerably
changed, and Eulalie endeavored to
make me prefer excitement and variety of amusement,
instead of the tranquil enjoyment which
had formerly charmed us. After some little
time I thought I observed that the books which
she selected for reading to me were of a different
character to those she used to like; she
seemed now to be more pleased with those
writers who painted the busy scenes of the
world, she unconsciously showed great interest
in the description of a f&ecirc;te, in the numerous
details of a woman's toilet, and in the preparations
for, and the pomps of a ceremony. At first
I did not imagine that she had forgotten that I
was blind, so that though this change chilled, it
did not break my heart. I attributed the alteration
in her taste, in some measure, to the new
aspect things had assumed at the Chateau; for
since M. Maunoir had performed one of the miracles
of his art upon Eulalie, M. Robert was
naturally much more inclined to enjoy society
and the luxuries which fortune had bestowed
upon him; and as soon as his daughter was restored
to him in all the perfection of her organization,
and the height of her beauty, he sought
to assemble, at the Chateau, the numerous
travelers that the short summer season brought
to the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"The winter came at length, and M. Robert
told me, after slightly preparing me, that he
was going to leave me for a few days&mdash;for a
few days at the most&mdash;he assured me that he
only required time to procure and get settled in
a house at Geneva, before he would send for me
to join them; he told me that Eulalie was to
accompany him; and at length, that he intended
to pass the winter at Geneva; the winter
which would so soon be over, which had already
begun. I remained mute with grief. Eulalie
wound her arms affectionately round my neck.
I felt they were cold and hung heavily on me;
if my memory still serves me she bestowed on
me all kinds of endearing and touching appellations;
but all this was like a dream. After
some hours I was restored to my senses, and
then my mother said, 'Gervais, they are gone,
but we shall remain at the Chateau.' From
that time I have little or nothing to relate.</p>

<p>"In the month of October she sent me a
ribbon with some words printed in relief, they
were these: 'This ribbon is the green ribbon
which I wore over my eyes&mdash;it has never left
me; I send it you.' In the month of November,
which was very beautiful, some servants of
the house brought me several presents from her
father, but I did not inquire about them. The
snow sets in in December, and, oh! heavens,
how long that winter was! January, February,
March, April, were centuries of calamities and
tempests. In the month of May the avalanches
fell every where except on me. When the sun
peeped forth a little, I was guided, by my wish,
to the road which led to Bossons, for this was
the way the muleteers came; at length, one
arrived, but with no news for me; and then
another, and after the third I gave up all hope
of hearing from my absent friends; I felt that
the crisis of my fate was over. Eight days
after, however, a letter from Eulalie was read
to me; she had spent the winter at Geneva, and
was going to pass the summer at Milan. My
poor mother trembled for me, but I smiled; it
was exactly what I expected. And now, sir,
you know my story, it is simply this, that I believed
myself loved by a woman, and I have
been loved by a dog. Poor Puck!" Puck
jumped on the blind man.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said he, "You are not my Puck, but
I love you because you love me."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," cried I, "you will be loved
by another, though not by her, and you will
love in return; but listen, Gervais, I must leave
Chamouny, and I shall go to Milan. I will see
her. I will speak to Eulalie, I swear to you,
and then I will return to you. I, too, have
some sorrows which are not assuaged; some
wounds which are not yet healed." Gervais
sought for my hand, and pressed it fervently.
Sympathy in misfortune is so quickly felt.
"You will, at least, be comfortably provided
for; thanks to the care of your protector, your
little portion of land has become very fruitful,
and the good Chamouniers rejoice in your prosperity.
Your prepossessing appearance will
soon gain you a mistress, and will enable you
to find a friend."</p>

<p>"And a dog?" replied Gervais.</p>

<p>"Ah! I would not give mine for your valley
or mountains if he had not loved you, but now
I give him to you."</p>

<p>"Your dog!" exclaimed he. "Your dog
ah! he can not be given away."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Adieu, Gervais!"</p>

<p>I did not speak to Puck, or he would have
followed me; as I was moving on I saw Puck
looked uneasy and ashamed; he drew back a
step, stretched out his paws, and bent down his
head to the ground. I stroked his long silky
coat, and with a slight pang at my heart, in
which there was no feeling of anger, I said, so.
He flew back to Gervais like an arrow. Gervais
will not be alone at any rate, thought I.</p>

<p>A few days afterward I found myself at
Milan. I was not in spirits for enjoying society,
yet I did not altogether avoid mixing in it; a
crowded room is, in its way, a vast solitude,
unless you are so unfortunate a person as to
stumble upon one of those never-tiring tourists
whom you are in the habit of meeting occasionally
on the Boulevards, at Tortoni's, or with
whom you have gaped away an hour at Favert's,
one of those dressed-up puppies with fashionable
cravat and perfumed hair, who stare through
an eye-glass, with the most perfect assurance
imaginable, and talk at the highest pitch of
their voice.</p>

<p>"What! are you here?" cried Roberville.</p>

<p>"Is it you?" replied I. He continued to
chatter, but his words were unheeded by me,
for my eyes suddenly fixed upon a young girl
of extraordinary beauty; she was sitting alone,
and leaning against a pillar in a kind of melancholy
reverie.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah!" said Roberville, "I understand;
your taste lies in that direction. Well, well,
really in my opinion you show considerable
judgment. I once thought of her myself, but
now I have higher views."</p>

<p>"Indeed," replied I, as I gazed at him from
head to foot, "you do not say so."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Roberville, "I perceive
your heart is already touched, you are occupied
only with her; confess that it would have been
a sad pity if those glorious black eyes had never
been opened to the light."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What do I mean? why, that she was born
blind. She is the daughter of a rich merchant
of Anvers, and his only child; he lost his wife
very young, and was plunged in consequence in
the profoundest grief."</p>

<p>"Do you believe it?"</p>

<p>"I should think so, for he quitted Anvers,
gave up his mercantile pursuits, which had never
been more profitable to him than at that time,
and, after making magnificent presents to those
persons employed in his service, and pensions to
his servants, left his house and occupation."</p>

<p>"And what became of him afterward?" said
I, somewhat impatiently, for my curiosity was
gradually increasing.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's a romance, a perfect romance.
This good man retired to Chamouny, where we
have all been once in our life, for the sake of
saying that we have been, though, for my part,
I can never understand the charms of its melancholy
grandeur, and there he remained several
years. Have you never heard him mentioned?
let me see, it's a plebeian name&mdash;M. Robert,
that's it."</p>

<p>"Well?" said I.</p>

<p>"Well," continued he, "an occulist succeeded
in restoring his daughter's sight. Her
father took her to Geneva, and at Geneva she
fell in love with an adventurer, who carried her
off because her father would not have him for a
son-in-law."</p>

<p>"Her father felt that he was unworthy of
her," said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, and he had formed a correct opinion
of him, for no sooner had they reached Milan
than the adventurer disappeared, with all the
gold and diamonds of which he had been able
to possess himself; it was asserted that this
gallant gentleman was already married, and
that he had incurred capital punishment at
Padua, so that the law punished him."</p>

<p>"And M. Robert?"</p>

<p>"Oh, M. Robert died of grief; but this affair
did not create a great sensation, for he was a
very singular man, who had some extraordinary
ideas; one of the absurd plans he had formed
was, to marry his daughter to a blind youth."</p>

<p>"Oh, the poor girl!"</p>

<p>"She is not so much to be pitied either, but
look at her instead of talking of her, and confess
that she has many advantages, with two
hundred thousand francs a year, and such a
pair of eyes!"</p>

<p>"Eyes, eyes, curses rest upon her eyes, for
they have been her ruin!" There is a leaven
of cruelty in my composition, and I like to make
those, who have caused others suffering, suffer
in their turn. I fixed one of those piercing
looks upon Eulalie, which, when they do not
flatter a woman, make her heart sink within
her; she raised herself from the pillar, against
which she was leaning, and stood motionless
and tremblingly before me. I went up to her
slowly, and whispered Gervais.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Gervais."</p>

<p>"Ah, Gervais," replied she, while she placed
her hand before her eyes.</p>

<p>The scene was so singular that it would have
shaken the nerves of the most composed person,
for my appearance there was altogether so sudden,
my acquaintance with her history so extraordinary.</p>

<p>"Ah, Gervais," exclaimed I, vehemently
seizing her at the same time by the arm, "what
have you done to him?" She sank to the ground
in a swoon. I never heard any more of her
from that memorable night.</p>

<p>I entered Savoy by Mount St. Bernard, and
again found myself once more in the valley of
Chamouny. Again I sought the rock where
Gervais was accustomed to sit, but though it
was his usual hour for sitting there, he was not
to be seen. I came up to the old spot, and
discovered his stick of Cytisus, and perceiving
that it was ornamented with a piece of green
ribbon, on which were some words printed in
relief, the circumstance of his leaving this behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
him made me feel very uneasy. I called
Gervais, loudly; a voice repeated Gervais; it
seemed to me like an echo; I turned round; and
beheld Marguerite, leading a dog by a chain.
They stopped, and I recognized Puck, though
he did not know me, for he seemed occupied by
some idea; he sniffed his nose in the air, raised
his ears, and stretched forth his paws, as if he
was going to start off.</p>

<p>"Alas, sir," said Marguerite, "have you met
with Gervais?"</p>

<p>"Gervais," replied I, "where is he?" Puck
looked at me as if he had understood what I
had said, he stretched himself toward me, as
far as his chain would permit; I stroked him
with my hand, the poor thing licked my fingers
and then remained still.</p>

<p>"I remember now, sir, that it was you who
gave him this dog to console him for one which
he had lost, a little while before you came
here; this poor animal had not been eight days
in the valley before he lost his sight like his
master."</p>

<p>"I lifted up Puck's silky head, and discovered
that he was indeed blind. Puck licked my hand,
and then howled.</p>

<p>"It was because he was blind," said Marguerite,
"that Gervais would not take him with
him yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yesterday, Marguerite! what, has he not
been home since yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, that is exactly what astonishes us
all so much. Only think on Sunday, in the
midst of a tremendous storm, a gentleman came
to the Valley; I could have declared he was an
English milord; he wore a straw hat, covered
with ribbons."</p>

<p>"Well, but what has all this to do with Gervais?"</p>

<p>"While I was running to fetch some fagots
to make a fire for drying M. Roberville's clothes,
he remained with Gervais. M. de Roberville!
yes, that was his name. I do not know what
he said, but yesterday Gervais was so melancholy;
he, however, seemed more anxious than
ever to go to the rock; indeed he was in such a
hurry that I had scarcely time to throw his blue
cloak over his shoulders; and I think I told you
that the evening before was very cold and
damp. 'Mother,' said he, as we went along,
'be so kind as to prevent Puck from following
me, and take charge of him; his restlessness
inconveniences me sometimes, and if he should
pull his chain out of my hand, we should not be
able to find each other again perhaps.'"</p>

<p>"Alas, Gervais!" cried I, "my poor Gervais!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Gervais! Gervais, my son! my little
Gervais!" sobbed the poor woman.</p>

<p>Puck gnawed his chain, and jumped impatiently
about us.</p>

<p>"If you were to set Puck at liberty, perhaps
he might find Gervais," said I.</p>

<p>The chain was unfastened, and before I had
time to see that Puck was free, he had darted
off, and the next moment I heard the sound of
a body falling into the depths of the Arveyron.
"Puck! Puck!" shouted I; but when I reached
the spot, the little dog had disappeared, and all
that could be seen was a blue mantle floating
on the surface of the waters.</p>

<h2>THE DAUGHTER OF BLOOD&mdash;A TALE OF SPANISH LIFE.</h2>


<p>At Aranjuez, some twenty years ago, there
lived a youth of the poorer class, whose
good nature and industry were the proverb of
the village. His name was Julio. His disposition
was naturally indolent, morally I mean
rather than physically; and although he was
by no means deficient in understanding, he
allowed himself to be guided by any person
who, for any purpose, thought fit to undertake
the task. Julio delighted in doing a kindness
and, as his good-nature equalled his ductility, he
granted every request, whether it lay in his
power or not. No one was more ready to play
at the village dance than Julio; and though he
loved to dance himself, he never thought of indulging
in this predilection until his companions,
knowing his weakness, insisted on his allowing
some one else to take the guitar. It was to
him always that damsels resorted who had
quarreled with their sweethearts, or youths who
had fallen under the displeasure of their Chloe;
for, on behalf of the first, he was best able to
soften jealousy and extort promises of future
amendment, and for the latter, he would smooth
matters by appropriate words, nay, often by a
small gift purchased by a sacrifice of part of his
own scanty store, and presented as though from
the culprit. Great were this charming young
man's accomplishments; and not only were his
companions, but the higher class of inhabitants,
grieved when his facile disposition brought him
into any scrape. It had always been supposed
that Julio was attached to a young girl, with
whom he had been brought up. His patrimonial
cottage adjoined to that of her parents,
and he had ever seemed to court her society
more than that of his other fair acquaintances.
As for her, she adored him. She was much of
the same disposition as himself, and undecided;
but in her love for him, she had come out of
herself; she would have followed him to the
scaffold, and would infinitely have preferred a
disagreeable death in his society, than the most
agreeable life without him. As yet he had
scarcely sufficiently reciprocated her attachment;
he liked her society; he perhaps did not object
to her devotion! nay, he wished to marry her;
but she had not inspired him with the same
absorbing love she herself felt; she had not
sufficient command over him to draw forth his
passion in its full tide; and while that passion
was accumulating, pent up for some event, she
was content with his simmering affection. Her
name was Faustina.</p>

<p>But his love was soon to be proved, and poor
Faustina's heart was to be sorely tried. While
she confidingly looked up to him who was
virtually her betrothed, she little thought how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
slight was the bond that attached him to her.
She knew his love did not reach one tithe of
that she would have wished, but she thought it
infinitely more than what it eventually appeared.</p>

<p>An Italian family from Madrid came to reside
during the spring months at Aranjuez. In
their retinue came Ursula, an Italian <i>femme-de-chambre</i>,
a woman whose name is never uttered
in the <i>pueblo</i> but with a curse.</p>

<p>She was older than Julio, who became acquainted
with her while employed in the house
in his trade as carpenter; but as she saw his
pliable disposition, and perhaps his nascent
passion, her experience and acuteness taught
her to turn them to account; and in a short
time she obtained such an ascendency over him,
that he became a perfect plaything in her
hands. He ruined himself in purchasing presents
for the artful woman; he furnished her
with all she required; he gave her money; in
fact, had she requested his life, it would not
have been considered an exorbitant demand.
Ursula was handsome, tall, dark, and fierce-looking
flashing eyes she had, with heavy
arched brows; and considering these advantages,
folks wondered that she would condescend
to turn her ideas so humbly; but after
inquiries showed that in her own land, and in
Madrid, her conduct had been so very profligate,
that all was now fish that came to her net, and
that, to obtain the consummation of the wishes
of every woman, a husband and independence,
she must stoop far below what must have been
her original expectations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile poor Faustina wept and prayed,
now scorned by Julio, but pitied by the little
world in which she had lived. She wept and
prayed, but tears seemed to afford no relief to
the maiden in her anguish, and prayers appeared
to have lost their efficacy: they brought
no success, nay, worse, no comfort. Still Julio
pursued his headlong career, heedless of the
past, the present, or the future. It was dreadful
to see the change in him: he seemed as one
possessed. The reckless passion that had been
roused by the wily Italian, burst all bounds,
knew no restraint, no path; it was like a torrent
that has been for some time dammed up, which,
when set free, acknowledges no demarkation, no
rule of banks or bed, but tears forward, involving
in its impetuous rage the verdure and bloom
that are around it.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs that occupied
the attention of all the Aranjovites, when one
morning Ursula the Italian disappeared. Julio
was at work when the fact was communicated
to him, which being done, he fell to the ground,
as though the intelligence had struck him dead;
and when he recovered from the swoon, he
raved, frantic. He wandered to Madrid, but
could discover no intelligence of her; he visited
all the neighboring towns, he inquired of the
police, but no trace of the woman could be
found, till at last the reaction of his spirits,
after the tense excitement, the grief, the balked
passion, seemed to have prostrated his senses;
he walked as a spectre, taking heed of no
passer-by, callous to all changes, careless of remark
and of appearance, a noonday ghoul preying
on his own misery. But now the prayers
of the poor girl who loved him so fondly seemed
to her to have been granted. She had not besought
a return of his former lukewarm regard,
only an opportunity of proving her own devotion;
and in his dull apathy she indeed proved
herself a loving woman. She followed him in
his walks, she arranged his cottage, sang to
him the songs she thought he best loved; nay,
to cheer him, would endeavor to repeat the airs
she had at times heard from the lips of her
Italian rival, though the attempt was but a
self-inflicted wound; and in the heat of the
day, she would take him often her own share of
the domestic meal, or placing his unconscious
head on her bosom, would tend him like a child,
as he lay half sleeping, half senseless.</p>

<p>Her constancy received a qualified reward&mdash;Count &mdash;&mdash;,
an officer having the chief authority
in the royal demesnes, hearing the story, offered
to Julio a good appointment in the gardens,
with the proviso that he should espouse Faustina.
To this Julio yielded without a sigh;
poverty was beginning to make itself felt, and
having resigned all hope of happiness he did not
anticipate increased misery. His marriage did
not alter his late mode of life. Listless and
stupid he wandered about the gardens, inspecting,
with an uninterested eye, the workmen
over whom he had been placed, and he would
soon have lost his appointment had it not been
for his wife, who, "tender and true," in addition
to her household duties, executed those
which had been committed to his charge, slaving
night and day for him she loved, careless of
suffering and of labor, her only object to win
his approbation, and some, however slight,
token of returned affection: but she labored in
vain; Julio did not see, or affected not to see,
these exertions; he would enter the house or
leave it, without uttering a syllable, while his
wife continued her thankless office, rewarded
only by her conscience. And how disheartening
a task it is to practice self-denial unappreciated,
to resign all for one who deigns not even
to bestow a word of kind approval. But thus
Faustina lived her life&mdash;one uninterrupted self-sacrifice.
Alas! how often are such lives passed
by women in every rank of life! How little
can a stranger tell the heroism that occurs beneath
the roofs of the noble or on the cold hearth
of the beggar; at odd times, at sudden epochs,
the world may hear of deeds practiced, that, of
old, would have deified the performer; but often,
how often, will noble acts, such as these, receive
a thankless return; years passed as this,
acknowledged only when too late; their premium
in life, perchance, may be harsh words or
curses, or transitory tears may moisten the
grave when the gentle spirit passes from its
earthly frame. These observations may be just,
but they are somewhat trite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus they lived for five years, one pretty
little girl being the only fruit of this union; a
child who, in her earliest days, was taught to
suffer, and who partook her mother's disposition,
nay, even her mother's character, as it
appeared, tempered by the grief of womanhood;
when one day, to the horror and disgust of the
township, Ursula, the <i>teterrima causa</i>, reappeared
at Aranjuez. She was grown much older in
appearance&mdash;years and evident care had worn
furrows in her cheeks; but the flashing eye of
sin was not yet dimmed, her head not bent, nor
the determination that had of old gained such
a baneful influence on the mind of Julio. One
morning Faustina, leaving her house, beheld her
husband in conversation with her rival. That day
had sealed her doom. Morning, noon, and night,
Julio was at the side of Ursula, as before, obeying
her slightest command, groveling at her feet,
like a slave; his ancient energy of passion had
returned, but only to brutalize his nature; instead
of cold looks to his wife, he now treated
her with blows at the rare interviews he held
with her; the cold apathy was changed into
deep hate, and though no direct act of violence
caused her death, the shock, the harshness,
added to neglect, soon broke her heart. Poor
Faustina died, blessing with her latest breath,
the being who had by his cruelty killed her, and
deprecating even remorse to visit him, she left
the world, in which she had loved in vain.</p>

<p>At her death, Julio found himself comparatively
wealthy&mdash;wealthy by her exertion; and
ere another moon shone over his roof, his bride,
the dark Italian, beat his child on the spot
where the mother had so lately died.</p>

<p>Dark rumors soon spread over the village, a
scowling Italian, given out by Ursula as her
brother, came and took up his abode in her
newly-acquired house; curious neighbors whispered
tales how, peeping in at night, they had
beheld the three deal heavy blows to poor Faustina's
daughter; screams often were heard
from the desecrated habitation, and the child
was never seen to leave the house. Julio had
recovered, to a certain extent, the use of his
faculties, and was enabled now himself to attend
to his affairs, but his subordinates soon
felt the loss of Faustina's mild rule, and with
the discrimination of the Spanish peasantry,
attributed their sufferings, not to the miserable
tool, but to the fiend-hearted woman.</p>

<hr />

<p>Julio was walking in the garden alone, during
the time usually devoted to the mid-day
sleep; his underlings were reclining beneath
the shade of the trees; and, at last, overcome
by the heat, he himself gave way to slumber;
his dreams were troubled, but were not of long
duration; for he had not long laid himself on the
sward, when he felt himself rudely shaken, and,
awaking, discovered an officer of justice standing
near him, who desired his society. The alguazil
led him to his own abode, and, on reaching
it, what did he behold? His wife, who was
then with child, pinioned, between two villagers
acting for the nonce as constables, one of whom
held in his hand a bloody <i>navaja</i>; the brother(!),
also pinioned, standing near her; and on
the ground, surrounded by a knot of peasants,
glad at the vengeance that was to overtake the
guilty pair, he saw the child of Faustina, decapitated,
dismembered, discovered thus on the
floor of the cottage, ere the murderous couple
had been enabled to conceal the mangled remains.
A workman, a near relation of Julio's
first wife, who had, by chance, heard a suppressed
scream in passing, hastily summoning
assistance, had arrived in time only to apprehend
the assassins, the shedders of innocent
blood. There was no flaw in the evidence, and,
ere long, Ursula and her paramour, for such was
the true relative position in which she stood
with the stranger, were sentenced to the doom
they so richly deserved. I have not, however,
ended, my narrative, but I will endeavor to curtail
the rest of my history, to me the strangest
part of it. Julio was not disenchanted; by extraordinary
exertions to save the mother of a
child, shrewdly suspected not to be his own, he
prevailed on his patron, Count &mdash;&mdash;, to procure
the commutation of his wife's sentence to a
term of imprisonment; and though the murderer
forfeited his life, the murderess escaped after
some years' incarceration, having given birth
to a child shortly after her trial, who, innocent,
bore on her brow the mark of the instrument of
her mother's crime; and, can it be credited!&mdash;Julio
took the woman to his home, his love
unabated, his subserviency undiminished!</p>

<p>They now live in Aranjuez, and the child is
left to wander about unnoticed, except with
punishment; my kind-hearted landlady alone
feeds the poor creature, whom all others shun:
and even she feels uncomfortable in the presence
of one born under such auspices. Her fellow-townsfolk,
as they pass the scene of virtue
and of crime, bless the memory of Faustina,
and curse the life of Ursula, praying for the
peace of the first one and of her child; and,
while execrating the latter, refuse shelter or
relief to her innocent offspring, who, in the
universal spirit of poetry that reigns in Spain, is
known far and near, and pointed to the stranger
as <i>La Hija de Sangre</i>, the Daughter of Blood.</p>

<h2>THE EXECUTION OF FIESCHI, MOREY, AND PEPIN.</h2>


<p>About one o'clock on a cold winter night in
1835, a party of four persons were seated
in the coffee-room of the H&ocirc;tel Meurice, at Paris.
It was chilly, sloppy, miserable weather; half-melted
snow, mixed with the Paris mud, and a
driving, sleety rain hissed against the ill-fitting
windows.</p>

<p>Our four convives were drinking&mdash;not the
wines of sunny France, but something much
more appropriate and homely&mdash;a curiously-fine
sample of gin, artfully compounded into toddy,
by Achille, the waiter.</p>

<p>When the clock struck one, three of the party
made a show of retiring; but the fourth, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
punchy gentleman from Wolverhampton, entreated
that the rest would not all desert him
while he discussed one glass more&mdash;nay, perhaps,
would join him! But here Achille was
inexorable: the master was in bed, and had
taken the keys.</p>

<p>Our four friends have taken their candles, and
are moving from the room, when a cab drives
rapidly to the door&mdash;there is a smart ring at
the bell, and a gentleman in full evening dress,
and enveloped in a Spanish cloak, hastily enters
the room.</p>

<p>"Who is inclined to see Fieschi's head chopped
off?" said the stranger, unfolding himself
from the cloak. "The execution is to take
place at daylight&mdash;I had it from a peer of
France, and the guillotine has been sent off an
hour ago."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>Our informant could not tell. It was known
only to the police&mdash;there was an apprehension
of some attempt at a rescue, and ten thousand
troops were to be on the ground. It will be
either the Place St. Jaques, or the Barri&egrave;re du
Tr&ocirc;ne&mdash;the first, most likely; let us try that to
begin with, and there will be plenty of time to
go on to the other afterward: but we must be
early, to get a good place.</p>

<p>We are not of those who make a practice of
attending executions with a morbid appetite for
such horrors. Under any circumstances, the
deliberate cutting off a life is a melancholy spectacle.
The mortal agony, unrelieved by excitement,
is painful in the extreme to witness, but
worse still is reckless bravado. Rarest of all
is it to see the inevitable fate met with calm
dignity. Here, however, was a miscreant,
who, to gratify a political feeling&mdash;dignified,
in his opinion, with the name of patriotism&mdash;deliberately
fired the contents of a battery
of gun-barrels into a mass of innocent persons,
many of whom, it was quite certain, would be
killed, for the chance of striking down one man,
and, probably, some of his family. That this
family, with their illustrious father, should have
escaped altogether, is an instance of good fortune
as remarkable as the attempt was flagitious.
But the magnitude of the crime invested
the perpetrators with a terrible interest, which
overcame any lingering scruples, and the whole
party decided upon setting out forthwith. We
made for the nearest coach-stand, which was
that upon the quay, near the Pont Neuf.</p>

<p>In something more than half an hour, we
jingled into the Place St. Jaques, and, pausing
at the corner, had the satisfaction to hear the
sounds of hammers busily plied upon a dark
mass rising in the centre of the square&mdash;it was
the platform upon which to erect the guillotine.
On all sides of this, workmen were busily engaged,
their labor quickened by the exhortations
of one who walked about, lantern in hand, upon
the top. This was the executioner, who, seen
by the light he carried, bore a remarkable resemblance
to the great English comedian, the
late Mr. Liston. There was the same square
form of the countenance, the small nose, the
long upper lip, the mirth-provoking gravity, and
the same rich, husky chuckle. This curious
likeness was at once acknowledged by all present,
and an Englishman took the liberty of interrupting
the grave functionary with the information
that he was the very image of <i>le plus
grand farceur que nous avons en Angleterre</i>, a
piece of information which the French scion of
the House of Ketch received, after the manner
of Frenchmen, as a high compliment, being
moved to bow and chuckle much thereat.</p>

<p>By this time, the hammering had roused the
dwellers in the place, and lights were seen
rapidly moving about the windows. A caf&eacute;-keeper
had opened his saloon, arranged his little
tables, and was bustling about with his
waiters attending to the wants of the guests
already assembled. An execution is a godsend
to the Place St. Jaques at any time, but the
execution of three great state criminals, such
as these, would go far to pay the year's rent of
the houses. As cabs and <i>fiacres</i> began to arrive,
we thought it necessary to make arrangement
for securing a room from whence to see
the execution, and chance conducted us to the
corner house, one side of which looked upon the
square, directly opposite the guillotine, from
which it was scarcely fifty yards distance; and
the other side fronted the road by which the
prisoners were to be conveyed from their prison
to the scaffold.</p>

<p>We found the situation well adapted for our
purpose, though only one window looked into
the square, the two others were easily made to
command a view of the scaffold, which was
nearly in a line with that side of the house.
Our host had also with much propriety made
the bed, set the furniture to rights, raked up the
ashes of the wood-fire, and put on another block
or two; and the fact of meeting with an open
fire-place instead of the eternal stove, made us
feel at home at once. The Wolverhampton
man declared that it was dangerous to British
lungs to be out in these raw mornings in a
foreign country without something warm to
qualify the air; so a bottle of brandy was sent
for to the neighboring <i>caf&eacute;</i>, and our hostess had
busied herself in producing hot water and tumblers,
as if, through the frequenters of executions,
she had arrived at considerable knowledge of
the national tastes. Our ancient host, being
accommodated with a cigar, narrated the particulars
of the many beheadings which had
fallen under his observation since his occupancy
of the house. One may be mentioned as exhibiting
a rare instance of irresistible curiosity.
The man had been guilty of an atrocious murder,
either of a wife or some near relative, and
when his neck was placed under the ax, he
contrived to slue himself partly round to see its
descent, and had a part of his chin taken off in
consequence.</p>

<p>About two hours before day-light a body of
mounted municipal guards arrived, and formed
round the scaffold. The object of this appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to be to hide the proceedings as much as possible
from those on foot, who could only hope for
a very imperfect view between the bodies and
the bear-skins of these troops. Soon after the
municipal guard the infantry of the line began
to arrive, and were formed in a circle four deep
outside the municipals, and nearly as far back
as the houses of the Place. A considerable
crowd had also collected, though extremely
orderly and good-humored; in fact, to see the
general hilarity, and listen to the bursts of loud
laughter, it would seem to be regarded in the
light of <i>f&ecirc;te</i>. There was certainly no appearance
of sympathy with the criminals. Finding
the municipals so materially interfered with the
show, the people soon began to occupy the trees
and lamp-posts, the adjacent walls, and the
roofs of the neighboring houses; while the infantry,
having piled arms, waltzed and danced
to keep themselves warm.</p>

<p>Soon after daylight the hammering ceased,
and the preparations appeared to be completed;
and shortly afterward strong bodies of cavalry
began to take up their positions in all the streets
leading into the Place. The first care of the
officer commanding these was to clear the square
entirely of all the people who had collected in
rear of the infantry, and to drive them out along
the adjacent streets; an order was also given
to dislodge the people out of the trees, and from
the walls and lamp-posts, and this caused much
grumbling and swearing of all concerned. Some
merriment, however, was excited by the discovery
of some women in the trees, and their
descent, superintended by the dragoons below,
gave occasion for the exercise of much not over
decent wit among the troopers. It struck me
that in their manner of dealing with the crowd
there was much unnecessary harshness on the
part of the troops, an irritability and fretfulness
often exhibited by persons doubtful of their own
authority, and very unlike the calm, good-humored
superiority with which our own men
are wont to handle the masses.</p>

<p>Presently came two general officers with their
staff, and each followed by a mounted "jockey,"
lads dressed as English grooms, of whom one,
as well by his fair complexion and honest round
face, the whiteness of his tops and leathers, and
the general superiority of his turn-out, as by his
firm and easy seat on horseback, was evidently
a native of our own country.</p>

<p>About an hour after sun-rise three caleches
came rapidly down the road, passing our windows,
each carriage containing three persons,
the condemned, and two police officers. The
troops opened out, and the men were landed at
the foot of the platform. It may be well to describe
the general appearance of the scaffold.</p>

<p>On a platform about twelve feet square, and
seven feet above the ground, are erected the
two upright posts, between which is suspended
the ax. They somewhat resemble a narrow
gallows, scarcely more than a foot between the
posts. The ax, which is not unlike a hay-knife,
though much heavier and broader, is
drawn up to the top of the posts, between which
it runs in grooves, and is held suspended by a
loop in the halyards, passed over a button at the
bottom. The edge of the ax, as it hangs suspended,
is not horizontal, or at a right angle
with the post, but diagonal, giving the instrument
a fearful power, in conjunction with its
weight and long fall, of shearing through a resisting
substance of many times more opposing
force than a human neck. On the centre of the
platform stands a frame, or large box, much resembling
a soldier's arm-chest, about six feet
long by two and a half wide, and probably as
much high. One end of this abuts upon the
upright posts, at the other end is a small frame
like a truck, connected about its centre with the
chest by hinges, and with a strap and buckle,
to make it fast to the man's body.</p>

<p>The prisoners having dismounted, were placed
in a line on the ground facing the guillotine,
their arms pinioned. They were very different
in appearance. Fieschi had a most sinister and
ferocious expression of face, rendered more so
by the scars, scarcely healed apparently, inflicted
by the bursting of his gun-barrels. He was
plainly dressed, and appeared like a workman
of the better class; his age about thirty-five.
Morey was a man advanced in life, perhaps
seventy; his bald head was partly covered with
a black cap revealing the white hairs behind,
and at the sides: he was a corpulent large
figure, dressed completely in black, with a mild
intelligent face, and altogether a very gentlemanly
air and manner. Pepin was a small,
thin-faced, insignificant man.</p>

<p>Pepin was chosen first for execution. Having
been deprived of his coat and neck-handkerchief,
and the collar of his shirt turned down, he was
led by the executioner up the steps of the platform.
He ascended with an air of considerable
bravado, shook himself, and looked round with
much confidence, and spoke some words which
we could not catch, and which the executioner
appeared disposed to cut short. Having advanced
with his breast against the truck, to
which his body was rapidly strapped, he was
then tilted down, truck and all, upon his face;
and the truck moving upon small wheels or
castors in grooves upon the chest, he was moved
rapidly forward, till his neck came directly under
the chopper, when the rope being unhooked from
the button, the ax fell with a loud and awful
"chop!" the head rolling down upon the bare
platform. After the separation of the head, the
body moved with much convulsive energy, and
had it not been made fast to what I have called
the truck, and that also connected with the
raised platform, would probably have rolled
down on the lower stage. The executioner then
held up the head to view for a moment, and I
suspect, from some laughter among the troops,
made a facetious remark. The lid of a large
basket alongside the chest was then raised, and
the body rolled into it.</p>

<p>Morey was the next victim. He ascended
the steps feebly, and requiring much assistance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
he was also supported during the process of
strapping him. His bald head and venerable
appearance made a favorable impression upon
the spectators, and elicited the only expressions
of sympathy observable throughout the
executions.</p>

<p>Fieschi came last, and was the most unnerved
of the three. He appeared throughout in a
fainting condition, and hung his head in a
pitiable state of prostration. Very little consideration
was shown him, or rather he was
pushed and thrust about in a way which was
indecent, if not disgusting, whatever might
have been his crimes. Some little difficulty occurred
in placing his head conveniently under
the ax, from a recoiling motion of the prisoner.
He was certainly the least brave of the three.
The executioner having rolled his body into the
larger basket with the others, took up that containing
the three heads, which having emptied
upon the bodies, he gave the bottom of the
basket a jocular tap, which, being accompanied
with a lifting of his foot behind, and probably
some funny and seasonable observation, created
a good deal of merriment among the spectators.</p>

<p>The guillotine is apparently the most merciful,
but certainly the most terrible to witness, of
any form of execution in civilized Europe. The
fatal chop, the raw neck, the spouting blood,
are very shocking to the feelings, and demoralizing;
as such exhibitions can not fail to generate
a spirit of ferocity and a love of bloodshed
among those who witness them. It was not
uncommon at this period in Paris to execute
sheep and calves with the guillotine; and
fathers of families would pay a small sum to
obtain such a gratifying show for their children.
In such a taste may we not trace the old leaven
of the first Revolution, and the germ of future
ones?</p>

<p>The fate of poor Dr. Guillotin was a singular
one. He lived to see the machine which he
had invented, from feelings of pure philanthropy,
made the instrument of the most horrible
butcheries, the aptness of the invention notoriously
increasing the number of the victims who
fell by it; and he died in extreme old age, with
the bitter reflection that his name would be
handed down to posterity, in connection with
the most detestable ferocities which have ever
stained the annals of mankind.</p>

<h2>PERSONAL HABITS AND CHARACTER OF THE WALPOLES.</h2>

<h3>BY ELIOT WARBURTON.</h3>


<p>We are not disposed to consider the elder
Horace Walpole a great statesman, or
claim for him the consideration accorded to his
mere celebrated brother; but he was superior
in talent to many of his contemporaries who
attained a much higher eminence; and his
honesty and zeal would have rendered creditable
a much less amount of political accomplishments
than he could boast of. Measured
with the diplomatists of a more modern period,
Lord Walpole will probably fall below par; but
he had no genius for that fine subtlety which
is now expected to pervade every important
negotiation, and knew nothing of that scientific
game of words, in which diplomatists of the
new school are so eager to distinguish themselves.</p>

<p>In appearance he was more fitted to appear
as a republican representative, than as an embassador
from a powerful sovereign to the most
polished court in Europe; his manners were so
unpolished, his form so inelegant, and his address
so unrefined. He rendered valuable support
to the English monarchy, and won the
confidence of the shrewd and calculating Queen
Caroline, as well as the esteem of the sagacious
and prudent States-general. A trustworthy
authority has styled him "a great master of
the commercial and political interests of this
country," and accorded him the merits of unwearied
zeal, industry, and capacity. With
such advantages, he might well confess, without
much regret, that he had never learned to
dance, and could not pride himself on making
a bow.</p>

<p>Though blunt and unpolished, he was extremely
agreeable in conversation; abounding
in pleasant anecdote, and entertaining reminiscences;
fond of society, affable to every one,
sumptuous in his hospitality, and not less estimable
in his domestic than in his social relations.
Though he wrote, and printed, and spoke lessons
of political wisdom, that met with the
fate of entire disregard, it is impossible not to
admire the unselfish zeal that would almost immediately
afterward induce him to write, print,
and speak similar instructive lessons, to the
same set of negligent scholars.</p>

<p>There is a statement which having found its
way into such an authority as "Chandler's
Debates," has been incorporated in works pretending
to historical accuracy. On a debate
arising out of the Bill for the Encouragement
and increase of Seamen, in 1740, Pitt is represented
as attacking Mr. Horace Walpole for
having ventured on a reference to his youth.
The fact is, that these debates were imaginary
or constructed on a very slight foundation. Dr.
Johnson, as is well known, before he had obtained
his colossal reputation, drew up fictitious
reports of what took place in the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>Mr. Walpole having in a discussion been
severely handled by Pitt, Lyttleton, and the
Granvilles, all of whom were much his juniors,
lamented that though he had been so long in
business, young men should be found so much
better informed in political matters than himself.
He added that he had at least one consolation
in remembering that his own son being
twenty years of age, must be as much the superior
of Pitt, Lyttleton, and the Granvilles, as
they were wiser than himself. Pitt having his
youth thus mercilessly flung in his face, got up
in a rage, commencing&mdash;"With the greatest
reverence to the gray hairs of the gentleman,"
but was stopped by Mr. Walpole pulling off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
his wig, and disclosing a grizzled poll beneath.
This excited very general laughter, in which
Pitt joined with such heartiness, as quite to
forget his anger.</p>

<p>The younger Walpole always preserved a delicacy
of figure, approaching effeminacy: his
dress was simple: his manners studiously courteous:
but his features, though agreeable, were
not handsome; the most expressive portion
being his eyes, which, when animated in conversation,
flashed with intelligence. A close
observer has stated, that "his laugh was forced
and uncouth, and even his smile not the most
pleasing." This may, perhaps, be attributed
to the pain he habitually suffered, since the
age of twenty-five, from the gout, which in the
latter part of his life attacked his hands and
feet with great severity. During the last half
of his existence he was not only extremely
abstemious, but his habits indicated a constitution
that could brave alterations of temperature,
from which much stronger men would
shrink.</p>

<p>His hour of rising was usually nine, and then,
preceded by his favorite little dog, which was
sure to be as plump as idleness and good feeding
could render it, he entered the breakfast-room.
The dog took his place beside him on
the sofa. From the silver tea-kettle, kept at
an even temperature by the lamp beneath, he
poured into a cup of the rarest Japan porcelain,
the beverage "that cheers, but not inebriates."
This was replenished two or three times, while
he broke his fast on the finest bread, and the
sweetest butter that could be obtained. He, at
the same time, fed his four-footed favorite, and
then, mixing a basin of bread and milk, he
opened the window, and threw it out to the
squirrels, who instantly sprang from bough to
bough in the neighboring trees, and then bounded
along the ground to their meal.</p>

<p>At dinner, which was usually about four
o'clock, he ate moderately of the lightest food,
quenching his thirst from a decanter of water
that stood in an ice-pail under the table. Coffee
was served almost immediately, to which he
proceeded up stairs, as he dined in the small
parlor or large dining-room, according to the
number of his guests. He would take his seat
on the sofa, and amuse the company with a
current of lively gossip and scandal, relieved
with observations on books and art, in illustration
of objects brought from the library or any
other portion of the house&mdash;for the whole might
be regarded as a museum. His snuff-box, filled
from a canister of <i>tabac d'etrennes</i> from Fribourg's,
placed in a marble urn at one of the
windows to keep it moist, was handed round,
and he frequently enjoyed its pungent fragrance
till his guests had departed&mdash;this was rarely
till about two o'clock. If earlier, Walpole was
sure to be found with pen in hand, continuing
whatever work he might have in progress, or
communicating to some of his numerous friends
the news and gossip of the day.</p>

<p>The whole of the forenoon, till dinner-time,
was often employed by him in attending upon
visitors, rambling about the grounds, or taking
excursions upon the river. He rarely wore a
hat, his throat was generally exposed, and he
was quite regardless of the dew, replying, to
the earnest solicitude of his friends, "My back
is the same with my face, and my neck is like
my nose."</p>

<p>Sometimes of an evening he would go out to
pay a visit to his neighbor, Kitty Clive, and
then the hours passed by in a rivalry of anecdote
and pleasantry; for Kitty, like himself
had seen a great deal of the world, and was
full of its recollections.</p>

<h2>AN INCIDENT OF INDIAN LIFE.</h2>


<p>In the year 1848 I found myself traveling
through the Mysorean country of Seringapatam,
so familiar to every reader of Indian history,
for the rapid rise of that crafty but talented
Asiatic Hyder Ali.</p>

<p>I had been reflecting as I passed through the
country on the warlike exploits and barbarous
cruelties by which it has been disfigured, and
on the short space of time in which, from the
first settlement by a few enterprising merchants
at Surat, in the year 1612, the English had,
either by force or diplomacy, possessed themselves
of the entire territory from Cape Comorin
to the Himalaya mountains; and, by an anomaly
of which history furnishes no parallel,
holding and enforcing their authority in great
measure by means of the very natives and
troops they have conquered, and who now lend
themselves to enslave their own country, and
rivet the shackles of bondage on their fatherland.
I asked myself the question&mdash;was the
time approaching when their fame, colonies,
and possessions would be among the things
that were? would they in process of development
be swept away before some nation not yet
cradled, or only in its infancy; or&mdash;proving an
exception to the whole experience of ages&mdash;would
they remain imperishably great and renowned
till the final dissolution of nature?</p>

<p>Bewildered at last with these reflections, I
left my palanquin; and, walking forward, with
a Manton across my shoulder, accompanied by
a Coolie carrying a double-barreled rifle, was
soon busily engaged peering into the thick
grass and underwood that lay on each side of
the path, intent only on scattering destruction
among some innocent and tender little bipeds,
with the laudable design of furnishing some
trifling addition to natural history, and a distant
hope of perhaps securing a shot among a
herd of deer faintly discernible in the outline.</p>

<p>In the incautious pursuit of a wild boar that
had crossed my path, I at length found myself
in the midst of a dense jungle&mdash;not the most
secure position in the world, with only a single
ebony gentleman at your side&mdash;for on the least
indication of danger, this representative of Lucifer
judiciously prefers present safety to future
reputation, and performs a retrograde movement
with undignified rapidity, leaving you alone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
apologize for your intrusion to a brute that can
not be persuaded to adopt polite manners, but
evinces an unmistakable desire to exhibit his
gratitude for your visit by a passionate and unceremonious
embrace. The tendency of long
ages of lost liberty and slavish superstition to produce
national degradation is forcibly exemplified
in the lower castes of the natives, who may
truthfully be said to have acquired all the vices
of their various conquerors, without any of their
redeeming qualities.</p>

<p>To return:&mdash;tired at last with my exertions
and the intensity of the heat, I dispatched my
sable attendant in quest of that peculiar Indian
luxury, the palanquin; and looking round for
some sheltered spot to await its coming up,
perceived a wide-spreading banyan tree. Trusting
to its friendly shelter, I was soon stretched
beneath a canopy of densely-clustered foliage,
sufficient to exclude all direct rays of the solar
star; and, lighting one of my best Indian pipes,
resigned myself to what brother Jonathan terms
a "tarnation smoke."</p>

<p>The scene before me was such as that which
Johnson in one of his rich and genial moods
would delight to portray&mdash;the image of beauty
reposing in the lap of sublimity was never more
aptly applied. The sun had attained its culminating
point, and was showering down its fervid
rays with a scorching influence; not a
breath stirred the forest air: all was hushed in
repose, and silent as the last breathings of the
departing soul&mdash;while a foreboding sensation
o'ershadowed the whole, as that beautiful couplet
in Campbell's "Lochiel" ominously crowded
on my memory,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coming events cast their shadows before.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I could not account for the oppressive silence,
for often before I had reclined at the foot of
some forest giant, and experienced widely different
feelings; all here seemed indescribably grand
and ennobling. The various tribes of baboons,
monkeys, and apes, screeching, chattering and
grinning overhead, anon leaping from tree to
tree, luxuriating in all the enjoyment of freedom
and revelry; while the jay, the parrot,
the peacock, with minor and sweeter minstrels
in every splendid variety of tropical plumage,
might be seen soaring or darting amidst the
foliage of forest verdure, combined with the
beauty and number of parasitical plants and
wild flowers. Such a scene of loveliness and
life had often enraptured me, till a second Eden
seemed realized; when, as if its aspect were
too beautiful for sinful earth, the illusion was
dissipated on observing the slender and graceful
form of a snake gliding swiftly in mazy folds
through the long grass&mdash;by that curious association
of ideas, suggesting at once the primal
fall, and the probable vicinity of a cobra couched
on the branch of a tree overhead, whose
color so closely approximates its tinge, that it
is almost impossible, without careful scrutiny,
to detect its presence, and if unconsciously disturbed
in its leafy cradle, the oscillation is resented
by darting its poisoned fang in the invader's
face. These insidious foes, and the
probability of a struggle with some carnivorous
denizen of the glen, suggest strong doubts as to
the security of your woodland abode, and damp
the pleasure the scene otherwise might afford.
And thus surely do we find that, in nature as
in life, under the most lovely and entrancing
aspects often lurk the most seductive and deadly
influences. The prospect loses nothing at
night, when effulgent with the pensive moonbeams,
and the myriads of fire-flies like living
stars broke loose from the dominion of old
night, delighted with their new-found liberty,
and dancing in a perfect jubilee of joyous light
through the embowering arcades, illuminating
every note of forest life; and on the one side is
heard the amorous roar of the antelope's midnight
suitor, as pending to the crashing march
of the gregarious elephant; and on the other
the nightly concert of a pack of jackalls, resembling
so closely the music of those "delightful"
babies, that it is only by continuous rehearsals
the ear can receive them with indifference&mdash;render
the whole indescribably magnificent, though
rather trying to delicate nerves.</p>

<p>All such sublimity and active life, however,
were now absent; not a living creature was to
be seen, and actuated by some indefinable impulse,
I involuntarily clutched my rifle. Scarcely
had I done so, when an agonizing shriek re-echoed
through the forest; rushing in the direction,
I encountered a sight that struck me
with horror and dismay&mdash;for a moment I stood
paralyzed!</p>

<p>A Brahmin, with his wife and only daughter,
were making a pilgrimage to the banks
of the sacred Ganges. With the characteristic
indifference of their caste, they had incautiously
halted in the midst of the jungle to
cook some rice. The little girl, while the
mother was occupied in preparing the frugal
meal, had thoughtlessly wandered into the long
grass in quest of some gaudy insect flitting
past: on a sudden the father, who had thrown
himself on the ground to snatch a few moments'
repose, was aroused by the screams of his child,
and, regaining his feet, perceived a full-grown
cheetah in the act of springing on his tender
girl. To see, and rush to her rescue, armed
only with a knife, was the work of an instant;
he arrived too late to arrest the tiger as he
made his rarely missing, and in this case fatal
spring on the beautiful and dark-bosomed maid.
A terrible struggle now ensued, the infuriated
animal relaxed its grasp of the child, and fastened
on the father. The tender and loving
wife, only now fully awakened to the extent of
the danger, forgetting her sex, insensible to
aught but her husband's peril, recklessly rushed
forward; but ere she could reach the spot to
become a third victim to the insatiate monster,
the providential flight of a bullet from a stranger's
rifle, penetrating the animal's brain, stretched
him dead at her feet. The brave husband, on
approaching the spot, lay extended on the grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
in the last agonies of death, dreadfully mangled,
the brute having torn away the greater part of
his brain and face. The little girl had already
expired.</p>

<p>Never can I forget the calmness and apparently
stoical indifference of this Indian woman
while her husband lay extended before her,
gasping his last. She supported his head, gently
wiping the blood from his face and lips; no sign
of her feelings could be detected in her features.
I gazed upon her with astonishment; but no
sooner was it evident that death had effectually
terminated the loved one's sufferings, than she
gave way to the most frantic and heart-rending
expressions of grief. The anguish of that woman
death alone can obliterate from my memory&mdash;words
can not picture it. I see her before
me as I write, alternately embracing the lifeless
and bloody bodies of her husband and child,
lavishing over them the most tender, endearing
invocations of affection, then as suddenly turning
round and seizing the crimson knife of her
heroic husband, plunged it again and again into
the body of the insensible animal, uttering all
the time the most fearful and violent imprecations
of despair and anguish.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest difficulty she could
at length be removed from the tragic scene,
and confided to the care of some neighboring
villagers. I had occasion to revisit the same
scenes some few months after, and found the
bereaved wife, but, indeed, how changed! I
could hardly recognize her. Day and night, I
was informed, she wandered about, calling on
her husband and child. A deep, settled gloom,
beyond any thing I ever witnessed, was upon
her features; her eyes had a wandering, restless
expression. She knew me immediately, and
talked in the most pathetic strain of her hapless
child and husband. Poor creature! I
tried to console her, but in vain. She said, her
only wish was, as soon as the monsoon, or
rainy season abated, to prosecute her journey to
the Ganges, and die by its sacred stream. I
remonstrated with her on this folly, and, explained
to her the divine truths of Christianity.
All in vain! She was fixed in her resolution;
and when I pointed to the heavens, and spoke
of the mercies of God and His power, she replied,
"that were He powerful, He could not be
merciful, or He would not have taken her husband
and child away without taking her also."
All I could say made no impression, nor seemed
to abate her determination, and time would not
permit my stay, nor did I ever chance again to
traverse the same scenes; but I have no doubt,
from my knowledge of Indian character, she
subsequently carried her resolution into effect.</p>

<h2>COFFEE PLANTING IN CEYLON.</h2>


<h3>IN TWO CHAPTERS.&mdash;CHAPTER THE FIRST.</h3>

<p>In the month of September, 1840, I started
from Kandy, the ancient capital of Ceylon,
to visit a friend who was in charge of one of
the many new coffee clearings then in progress.
I was accompanied by a young planter well acquainted
with the country and the natives, and
who had offered to act as my guide. The
clearing was distant about twenty-five miles.
The route we took has since become famous.
Rebellion and martial law have stalked over it;
and concerning it, the largest blue books of last
session have been concocted.</p>

<p>We mounted our horses a good hour before
day-break, so as to insure getting over the most
exposed part of our journey before the sun
should have risen very high, an important matter
for man and beast in tropical countries.
Toward noon, we pulled up at a little bazaar,
or native shop, and called for "<i>Hoppers and
Coffee</i>." I felt that I could have eaten almost
any thing, and, truly, one needs such an appetite
to get down the dreadful black-draught
which the Cingalese remorselessly administer to
travelers, under the name of coffee.</p>

<p>The sun was high in the horizon when we
found ourselves suddenly, at a turn of the road,
in the midst of a "clearing." This was quite
a novelty to me; so unlike any thing one meets
with in the low country, or about the vicinity
of Kandy. The present clearing lay at an elevation
of fully three thousand feet above the
sea-level, while the altitude of Kandy is not
more than sixteen hundred feet. I had never
been on a Hill Estate, and the only notions
formed by me respecting a plantation of coffee,
were of continuous, undulating fields, and gentle
slopes. Here it was not difficult to imagine
myself among the recesses of the Black Forest.
Pile on pile of heavy, dark jungle, rose before
my astonished sight, looking like grim fortresses
defending some hidden city of giants. The
spot we had opened upon was at the entrance
of a long valley of great width, on one side of
which lay the young estate we were bound to.
Before us were, as near as I could judge, fifty
acres of felled jungle in thickest disorder; just
as the monsters of the forest had fallen, so they
lay, heap on heap, crushed and splintered into
ten thousand fragments. Fine brawny old fellows
some of them; trees that had stood many
a storm and thunder-peal; trees that had sheltered
the wild elephant, the deer, and the buffalo,
lay there prostrated by a few inches of
sharp steel. The "fall" had taken place a
good week before, and the trees would be left in
this state until the end of October, by which
time they would be sufficiently dry for a good
"burn." Struggling from trunk to trunk, and
leading our horses slowly over the huge rocks
that lay thickly around, we at last got through
the "fall," and came to a part of the forest
where the heavy, quick click of many axes told
us there was a working-party busily employed.
Before us, a short distance in the jungle, were
the swarthy, compact figures of some score or
two of low country Cingalese, plying their small
axes with a rapidity and precision that was
truly marvelous. It made my eyes wink again,
to see how quickly their sharp tools flew about,
and how near some of them went to their
neighbors' heads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of these busy people I found
my planting friend, superintending operations,
in full jungle costume. A sort of wicker helmet
was on his head, covered with a long padded
white cloth, which hung far down his back, like
a baby's quilt. A shooting-jacket and trowsers
of checked country cloth; immense leech-gaiters
fitting close inside the roomy canvas boots;
and a Chinese-paper umbrella, made up his
curious outfit.</p>

<p>To me it was a pretty, as well as a novel
sight, to watch the felling work in progress.
Two ax-men to small trees; three, and sometimes
four, to larger ones; their little bright
tools flung far back over their shoulders with a
proud flourish, and then, with a "whirr," dug
deep in the heart of the tree, with such exactitude
and in such excellent time, that the scores
of axes flying about me seemed impelled by
some mechanical contrivance, and sounding but
as one or two instruments. I observed that in
no instance were the trees cut through, but
each one was left with just sufficient of the
heart to keep it upright; on looking around, I
saw that there were hundreds of them similarly
treated. The ground on which we were
standing was extremely steep and full of rocks,
between which lay embedded rich veins of alluvial
soil. Where this is the case, the masses
of stone are not an objection; on the contrary,
they serve to keep the roots of the young coffee
plants cool during the long dry season, and, in
the like manner, prevent the light soil from
being washed down the hill-side by heavy rains.
My planter-friend assured me that, if the trees
were to be at once cut down, a few at a time,
they would so encumber the place as to render
it impossible for the workmen to get access to
the adjoining trees, so thickly do they stand together,
and so cumbersome are their heavy
branches. In reply to my inquiry as to the
method of bringing all these cut trees to the
ground, I was desired to wait until the cutting
on the hill-side was completed, and then I should
see the operation finished.</p>

<p>The little axes rang out a merry chime&mdash;merrily
to the planter's ear, but the death-knell
of many a fine old forest tree. In half an hour
the signal was made to halt, by blowing a
conch shell; obeying the signal of the superintendent,
I hastened up the hill as fast as my
legs would carry me, over rocks and streams,
halting at the top, as I saw the whole party do.
Then they were ranged in order, axes in hand,
on the upper side of the topmost row of cut
trees. I got out of their way, watching anxiously
every movement. All being ready, the
manager sounded the conch sharply: two score
voices raised a shout that made me start again;
forty bright axes gleamed high in air, then sank
deeply into as many trees, which at once yielded
to the sharp steel, groaned heavily, waved
their huge branches to and fro, like drowning
giants, then toppled over, and fell with a stunning
crash upon the trees below them. These
having been cut through previously, offered no
resistance, but followed the example of their
upper neighbors, and fell booming on those beneath.
In this way the work of destruction
went rapidly on from row to row. Nothing was
heard but groaning, crackling, crashing, and
splintering; it was some little time before I got
the sounds well out of my ears. At the time
it appeared as though the whole of the forest-world
about me was tumbling to pieces; only
those fell, however, which had been cut, and of
such not one was left standing. There they
would lie until sufficiently dry for the torch that
would blacken their massive trunks, and calcine
their many branches into dusty heaps of alkali.
By the time this was completed, and the
men put on to a fresh "cut," we were ready
for our mid-day meal, the planter's breakfast.
Away we toiled toward the <i>bungalow</i>. Passing
through a few acres of standing forest, and
over a stream, we came to a small cleared space
well sheltered from wind, and quite snug in
every respect. It was thickly sown with what
I imagined to be young lettuces, or, perhaps,
very juvenile cabbage-plants, but I was told
this was the "Nursery," and those tiny green
things were intended to form the future Soolookande
Estate. On learning that we had reached
the "Bungalow," I looked about me to discover
its locality, but in vain; there was no
building to be seen; but presently my host
pointed out to me what I had not noticed before&mdash;a
small, low-roofed, thatched place, close
under a projecting rock, and half hid by thorny
creepers. I imagined this to be his fowl-house,
or, perhaps, a receptacle for tools; but was not
a little astonished when I saw my friend beckon
me on, and enter at the low, dark door.
This miserable little cavern could not have
been more than twelve feet long by about six
feet wide, and as high at the walls. This
small space was lessened by heaps of tools, coils
of string, for "lining" the ground before planting,
sundry boxes and baskets, an old rickety
table, and one chair. At the farther end&mdash;if
any thing could be far in that hole&mdash;was a jungle
bedstead, formed by driving green stakes in
the floor and walls, and stretching rope across
them. I could not help expressing astonishment
at the miserable quarters provided for one
who had so important a charge, and such costly
outlay to make. My host, however, treated the
matter very philosophically. Every thing, he
observed, is good or bad by comparison; and
wretched as the accommodation appeared to
me, who had been accustomed to the large,
airy houses of Colombo, he seemed to be quite
satisfied; indeed, he told me, that when he had
finished putting up this little crib, had moved
in his one table and chair, and was seated,
cigar in mouth, inside the still damp mud walls,
he thought himself the happiest of mortals. I
felt somewhat curious to know where he had
dwelt previous to the erection of this unique
building&mdash;whether he had perched up in the
forest trees, or in holes in the rocks, like the
wild Veddahs of Bintenne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>I was told that his first habitation, when
commencing work up there, was then suspended
over my head. I looked up to the dark,
dusty roof, and perceived a bundle of what I
conceived to be old dirty, brown paper, or
parchment-skin. Perceiving my utter ignorance
of the arrangement, he took down the roll, and
spread it open outside the door. It turned out
to be a huge <i>talipot-leaf</i>, which he assured me
was the only shelter he had possessed for nearly
two months, and that, too, during the rainy
season. It might have measured ten feet in
length, and possibly six in width; pretty well
for a leaf; it was used by fastening a stout
pole lengthways to two stakes driven in the
ground; the leaf was hung across this ridgepole,
midway, and the corners of it made fast
by cords: common mats being hung at each
end, and under the leaf.</p>

<p>The "Lines," a long row of mud huts for
the coolies, appeared to be much more comfortable
than their master's dwelling. But this is
necessarily the case, for, unless they be well-cared
for, they will not remain on a remote
estate, such as this one was then considered.
The first thing a good planter sees to is a roomy
and dry set of "Lines" for the people: then
the "Nursery" of coffee plants; and, thirdly, a
hut for himself.</p>

<p>The superintendent assured me that none
but those who had opened an estate in a remote
district, could form any idea of the difficulties
and privations encountered by the planter.
"Folks may grumble as they like, down in Colombo,
or in England," said my friend, "about
the high salaries paid to managers, but if some
of them had only a month of it up here, in the
rains, I suspect they'd change their notions."</p>

<p>He had had the greatest difficulty at first in
keeping but a dozen men on the place to clear
ground for lines and nurseries: so strong is the
objection felt by Malabars to new and distant
plantations. On one occasion he had been quite
deserted: even his old cook ran away, and he
found himself with only a little Cingalese boy,
and his rice, biscuit, and dried fish, all but exhausted.
As for meat, he had not tasted any
for many days. There was no help for it, he
saw, but to send off the little boy to the nearest
village, with a rupee, to buy some food, and try
to persuade some of the village people to come
up and assist him. When evening came on,
there was no boy back, and the lonely planter
had no fire to boil his rice. Night came on and
still he was alone: hungry, cold, and desolate.
It was a Sabbath evening, and he pointed out
to me the large stone on which he had sat
down to think of his friends in the old country;
the recollection of his distance from them, and
of his then desolate, Crusoe-like, position, came
so sadly upon him that he wept like a child.
I almost fancied I saw a tear start to his large
eye as he related the circumstance.</p>

<p>Ceylon planters are proverbially hospitable:
the utmost stranger is at all times sure of a
hearty welcome for himself and his horse. On
this occasion, my jungle friend turned out the
best cheer his small store afforded. It is true
we had but one chair among us, but that only
served to give us amusement in making seats
of baskets, boxes, and old books. A dish of
rice, and curry, made of dry salt fish, two red
herrings, and the only fowl on the estate, formed
our meal; and, poor as the repast may appear
to those who have never done a good day's
journey in the jungles of Ceylon, I can vouch for
the keen relish with which we all partook of it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we strolled out to inspect
the first piece of planting on the Soolookande
estate. It was in extent about sixty acres, divided
into fields of ten acres by narrow belts
of tall trees. This precaution was adopted, I
learnt, with a view to protect the young plants
from the violence of the wind, which at times
rushes over the mountains with terrific fury.
Unless thus sheltered by belts or "staking," the
young plants get loosened, or are whirled round
until the outer bark becomes worn away, and
then they sicken and die, or if they live, yield
no fruit. "Staking" is simply driving a stout
peg in the ground, and fastening the plant
steadily to it; but it is an expensive process.
The young trees in these fields had been put out
during the previous rains of July, and though
still very small, looked fresh and healthy. I
had always imagined planting out to be a very
easy and rough operation; but I now learnt
that exceeding care and skill are required in the
operation. The holes to receive the young coffee-plant
must be wide and deep&mdash;they can
scarcely be too large; the earth must be kept
well about the roots of the seedling in removing
it; and care must be taken that the <i>tap-root</i> be
neither bent, nor planted over any stone or
other hard substance; neglect of these important
points is fatal to the prosperity of the
estate. The yellow drooping leaves, and stunted
growth, soon tell the proprietor that his superintendent
has done his work carelessly; but, alas!
it is then too late to apply any remedy, save
that of re-planting the ground.</p>

<p>I left this estate impressed with very different
notions concerning the life and trials of a
planter in the far jungle, from those I had contracted
below from mere Colombo gossip; and
I felt that superintendents were not so much
overpaid for their skill, patience, privations, and
hard work.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER THE SECOND.</h3>

<p>Having seen almost the commencement of
the Soolookande Coffee Estate, I felt a strong
desire toward the end of the year 1846, to pay
it a second visit, while in its full vigor. I wished
to satisfy myself as to the correctness of the
many reports I had heard of its heavy crops, of
its fine condition, its excellent works, and, not
least, of the good management during crop-time.
My old acquaintance was no longer in
charge; he had been supplanted by a stranger.
However, I went armed with a letter from the
Colombo agents, which would insure more attention
than a bed and a meal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>I journeyed this time by another and rather
shorter route. Instead of taking the Matelle
road, I struck off to the right, past Davy's Tree,
celebrated as the scene of the massacre of a
large body of British officers and troops by the
treacherous Kandians, and crossing the Mahavilla
Ganga, at Davy's Ferry, made the best of
my way across the beautiful vale of Dombera,
and thence toward the long range of mountains
forming one flank of the Kallibokke Valley. At
the period of my former excursion this long tract
of fertile country was one unbroken mass of
heavy jungle; now a dozen large estates, with
bungalows and extensive works, were to be seen,
enlivening the journey, and affording a much
readier passage for the horseman; for wherever
plantations are formed, good jungle paths are
sure to be made. The ride was a most interesting
one; mile upon mile of coffee lay before
and around me, in various stages of growth,
from the young seedling just put out, to the
full-bearing bush, as heavily laden with red,
ripe coffee berries as any currant-bush in England
with its fruit.</p>

<p>It was then the middle of November, and the
very height of the planter's harvest. All appeared
busy as I rode along, gathering on the
old properties; weeding and "supplying," or
filling up failures on the young estates. I halted
but once for a cup of good, wholesome coffee,
and gladly pushed on, so as to reach my destination
in good time for breakfast.</p>

<p>The many lovely prospects opening before me
caused some little delay in admiration; and, by
the time I had ridden through the last piece of
jungle, and pulled up at the upper boundary of
"Soolookande," it was not far from mid-day.
The sun was blazing high above me, but its
rays were tempered by a cool breeze that swept
over from the neighboring mountain-tops. The
prospect from that lofty eminence was lovely
in the extreme: steep ridges of coffee extended
in all directions, bounded by piles of mossy forest;
white spots, here and there, told of bungalows
and stores; a tiny cataract rushed down
some cleft rock, on one side; on the other, a
rippling stream ran gently along, thickly studded
with water-cresses. Before me, in the far
distance, lay outstretched, like a picture-scroll,
the Matelle district, with its paddy fields, its
villages, and its Vihares, skirted by a ridge of
mountains and terminated by the Cave Rocks
of Dambool. At my feet, far below, lay the
estate, bungalow, and works, and to them I
bent my way by a narrow and very steep bridle-path.
So precipitous was the land just here,
that I felt rather nervous on looking down at
the white buildings. The pathway, for a great
length, was bordered by rose-bushes, or trees, in
fullest blossom, perfuming the air most fragrantly:
as I approached the bungalow, other flowering
shrubs and plants were mingled with them,
and in such excellent order was every thing
there that the place appeared to me more like a
magnified garden than an estate. How changed
since my former visit! I could scarcely recognize
it as the same property. The bungalow
was an imposing-looking building, the very picture
of neatness and comfort. How different to
the old talipot-leaf, and the dirty little mud hut!
The box of a place I had slept in six years before
would have stood, easily, on the dining-table
in this bungalow. A wide verandah surrounded
the building, the white pillars of which
were polished like marble. The windows were
more like doors; and, as for the doors, one may
speak of them as lawyers do of Acts of Parliament,
it would be easy to drive a coach-and-six
through them.</p>

<p>The superintendent was a most gentlemanly
person, and so was his Bengalee servant. The
curry was delightfully hot; the water was deliciously
cool. The chairs were like sofas; and
so exquisitely comfortable, after my long ride,
that, when my host rose and suggested a walk
down to the works, I regretted that I had said
any thing about them, and had half a mind to
pretend to be poorly.</p>

<p>The store was a zinc-roofed building, one
hundred feet in length, by twenty-five wide; it
was boarded below, but the sides upward were
merely stout rails, for insuring a thorough circulation
of air through the interior. It presented
a most busy appearance. Long strings of
Malabar coolies were flocking in, along narrow
paths, from all sides, carrying bags and baskets
on their heads, filled with the ripe coffee. These
had to pass in at one particular door of the
store, into the receiving-floor, in the upper part
of the building. A Canghany was stationed
there to see each man's gathering fairly measured;
and to give a little tin ticket for every
bushel, on the production of which the coolies
were paid, at the end of the month. Many
coolies, who had their wives and children to assist
them in the field, brought home very heavy
parcels of coffee.</p>

<p>Passing on to the floor where the measuring
was in progress, I saw immense heaps of ripe,
cherry-looking fruit, waiting to be passed below
to the pulpers. All this enormous pile must be
disposed of before the morning, or it will not be
fit for operating on, and might be damaged. I
saw quantities of it already gliding downward,
through little openings in the floor, under which
I could hear the noise of some machinery in
rapid motion, but giving out sounds like sausage-machines
in full "chop." Following my guide,
I descended a ladder, between some ugly-looking
wheels and shafting, and landed safely on
the floor of the pulping-room. "Pulping" is
the operation of removing the outer husk, or
"cherry," which incloses the parchment-looking
husk containing the pair of coffee beans.
This is performed by a machine called a "pulper."
It is a stout wooden or iron frame, supporting
a fly-wheel and barrel of wood, covered
with sheet copper, perforated coarsely outward,
very like a huge nutmeg-grater. This barrel is
made to revolve rapidly, nearly in contact with
two chocks of wood. The coffee in the cherry
being fed on to this by a hopper, is forced between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the perforated barrel and the chocks; the
projecting copper points tear off the soft cherry,
while the coffee beans, in their parchment case,
fall through the chocks into a large box. These
pulpers (four in number) were worked by a
water-wheel of great power, and turned out in
six hours as much coffee as was gathered by
three hundred men during the whole day.</p>

<p>From the pulper-box the parchment coffee is
shoveled to the "cisterns"&mdash;enormous square
wooden vats. In these the new coffee is placed,
just covered with water, in which state it is
left for periods varying from twelve to eighteen
hours, according to the judgment of the manager.
The object of this soaking is to produce
a slight fermentation of the mucilaginous matter
adhering to "the parchment," in order to
facilitate its removal, as otherwise it would
harden the skin, and render the coffee very difficult
to peel or clean. When I inspected the
works on Soolookande, several cisterns of fermented
coffee were being turned out, to admit
other parcels from the pulper, and also to enable
the soaked coffee to be washed. Coolies were
busily employed shoveling the berries from one
cistern to another; others were letting on clean
water. Some were busy stirring the contents
of the cisterns briskly about; while some, again,
were letting off the foul water; and a few were
engaged in raking the thoroughly-washed coffee
from the washing platforms to the barbecues.</p>

<p>The barbecues on this property were very
extensive: about twenty thousand square feet,
all gently sloped away from their centres, and
smooth as glass. They were of stone, coated
over with lime well polished, and so white, that
it was with difficulty I could look at them with
the sun shining full upon their bright surfaces.
Over these drying grounds the coffee, when
quite clean and white, is spread, at first thickly,
but gradually more thinly, until, on the last
day, it is placed only one bean thick. Four
days' sunning are usually required, though occasionally
many more are necessary before the
coffee can be heaped away in the store without
risk of spoiling. All that is required is to dry
it sufficiently for transport to Kandy, and thence
to Colombo, where it undergoes a final curing
previous to having its parchment skin removed,
and the faulty and broken berries picked out.
Scarcely any estates are enabled to effectually
dry their crops, owing to the long continuance
of wet weather on the hills.</p>

<p>The "dry floor" of this store resembled very
much the inside of a malting-house. It was
nicely boarded, and nearly half full of coffee,
white and in various stages of dryness. Some
of it, at one end, was being measured into two
bushel bags, tied up, marked and entered in the
"packed" book, ready for dispatch to Kandy.
Every thing was done on a system; the bags
were piled up in tens; and the loose coffee was
kept in heaps of fixed quantities as a check on
the measuring. Bags, rakes, measures, twine,
had all their proper places allotted them. Each
day's work must be finished off-hand at once;
no putting off until to-morrow can be allowed,
or confusion and loss will be the consequence.
Any heaps of half dried coffee, permitted to remain
unturned in the store, or not exposed on
the "barbecue," will heat, and become discolored,
and in that condition is known among
commercial men as "Country Damaged."</p>

<p>The constant ventilation of a coffee store is
of primary importance in checking any tendency
to fermentation in the uncured beans;
an ingenious planter has recently availed himself
of this fact, and invented an apparatus
which forces an unbroken current of dry, warm
air, through the piles of damp coffee, thus continuing
the curing process in the midst of the
most rainy weather.</p>

<p>When a considerable portion of the gathering
is completed, the manager has to see to his
means of transport before his store is too crowded.
A well conducted plantation will have its
own cattle to assist in conveying the crop to
Kandy; it will have roomy and dry cattle-pens,
fields of guinea-grass, and pasture grounds
attached, as well as a manure-pit, into which all
refuse and the husks of the coffee are thrown,
to be afterward turned to valuable account.</p>

<p>The carriage of coffee into Kandy is performed
by pack-bullocks, and sometimes by the
coolies, who carry it on their heads, but these
latter can seldom be employed away from picking
during the crop time. By either means,
however, transport forms a serious item in the
expenses of a good many estates. From some
of the distant hill-estates possessing no cattle,
and with indifferent jungle-paths, the conveyance
of their crops to Kandy will often cost
fully six shillings the hundred weight of clean
coffee, equal to about three pence per mile.
From Kandy to Colombo, by the common bullock-cart
of the country, the cost will amount
to about two or three shillings the clean hundred
weight, in all, eight or nine shillings the hundred
weight from the plantation to the port of shipment,
being twice as much for conveying it
less than a hundred miles, as it costs for freight
to England, about sixteen thousand miles. One
would imagine that it would not require much
sagacity to discern that, in such a country as
this, a railroad would be an incalculable benefit
to the whole community. To make this apparent
even to the meanest Cingalese capacity,
we may mention that, even at the present
time, transit is required from the interior of the
island to its seaports, for enough coffee for shipment
to Great Britain alone, to cause a railroad to
be remunerative. The quantity of coffee imported
from British possessions abroad in 1850, was
upward of forty millions of pounds avoirdupois;
and a very large proportion of this came from
Ceylon. What additional quantities are required
for the especially coffee-bibbing nations
which lie between Ceylon and this country, surpass
all present calculation; enough, we should
think, sails away from this island in the course of
every year, the transit of which to its sea-board,
would pay for a regular net-work of railways.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<h2>A BRETON WEDDING.</h2>


<p>The customs and habits of the Bretons bear
a close and striking resemblance to those of
their kindred race<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in the principality of Wales.</p>

<p>When a marriage in Lower Brittany has
been definitely resolved upon, the bride makes
choice of a bridesmaid, and the bridegroom of a
groomsman. These, accompanied by an inviter,
or "bidder," as the personage is called in Wales,
bearing a long white wand, invite the members
of their respective families to the wedding. On
so important and solemn an occasion, no one is
forgotten, however humble his condition in life
may happen to be; and in no country in the
world are the ties of kindred so strong as in
Lower Brittany.</p>

<p>These consequently include a very large circle;
and it happens that the task of "bidding" very
frequently occupies many days. A thousand
persons have been known to assist at the
wedding of a prosperous farmer.</p>

<p>On the Sunday preceding the wedding-day,
every one who has accepted the invitation must
send some present to the youthful pair, by one
of their farm servants, who has been very carefully
dressed, in order to produce a high idea of
their consequence. These gifts are sometimes
of considerable value, but for the most part
confined to some article of domestic use, or of
consumption on the wedding-day, which is
usually fixed for the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>At an early hour of that day the young men
assemble in a village near to the residence of
the bride, where the bridegroom meets them.
As soon as they are collected in sufficiently
imposing numbers, they depart in procession,
preceded by the <i>basvalan</i> (embassador of love),
with a band of music, of which the bagpipe is a
conspicuous instrument, to take possession of
the bride. On arriving at the farm, every thing,
save the savage wolf-dogs, is in the most profound
silence. The doors are closed, and not a
soul is to be seen; but on closely surveying the
environs of the homestead, there is sufficient
indication of an approaching festivity, chimneys
and caldrons are smoking, and long tables
ranged in every available space.</p>

<p>The <i>basvalan</i> knocks loudly and repeatedly at
the door, which at length brings to the threshold
the <i>brota&euml;r</i> (envoy of the bride's family), who,
with a branch of broom in his hand, replies in
rhyme, and points out to some neighboring
chateau, where he assures the <i>basvalan</i> such a
glorious train as his is sure to find welcome on
account of its unparalleled splendor and magnificence.
This excuse having been foreseen, the
<i>basvalan</i> answers his rival, verse for verse, compliment
for compliment, that they are in search
of a jewel more brilliant than the stars, and
that it is hidden in that "palace."</p>

<p>The <i>brota&euml;r</i> withdraws into the interior; but
presently leads forth an aged matron, and presents
her as the only jewel which they possess.</p>

<p>"Of a verity," retorts the <i>basvalan</i>, "a most
respectable person; but it appears to us that
she is past her festal time; we do not deny the
merit of gray hair, especially when it is silvered
by age and virtue; but we seek something far
more precious. The maiden we demand is at
least three times younger&mdash;try again&mdash;you can
not fail to discover her from the splendor which
her unequaled beauty sheds around her."</p>

<p>The <i>brota&euml;r</i> then brings forth, in succession,
an infant in arms, a widow, a married woman,
and the bridesmaid; but the embassador always
rejects the candidates, though without wounding
their feelings. At last the dark-eyed blushing
bride makes her appearance in her bridal attire.</p>

<p>The party then enters the house, and the
<i>brota&euml;r</i>, falling on his knees, slowly utters a
<i>Pater</i> for the living, and a <i>De Profundis</i> for the
dead, and demands the blessing of the family
upon the young maiden. Then the scene, recently
so joyous, assumes a more affecting character,
and the <i>brota&euml;r</i> is interrupted by sobs and
tears. There is always some sad episode in
connection with all these rustic but poetic
festivals in Brittany. How many sympathies
has not the following custom excited? At the
moment of proceeding to church, the mother
severs the end of the bride's sash, and addresses
her: "The tie which has so long united us,
my child, is henceforward rent asunder, and I
am compelled to yield to another the authority
which God gave me over thee. If thou art
happy&mdash;and may God ever grant it&mdash;this will
be no longer thy home; but should misfortune
visit thee, a mother is still a mother, and her
arms ever open for her children. Like thee, I
quitted my mother's side to follow a husband.
Thy children will leave thee in their turn.
When the birds are grown, the maternal nest
can not hold them. May God bless thee, my
child, and grant thee as much consolation as
he has granted me!" The procession is then
formed, and the cavalcade proceeds to the parish
church; but every moment it is interrupted in
its progress by groups of mendicants, who climb
up the slopes bordering the roads&mdash;which are
extremely deep and narrow&mdash;to bar the passage
by means of long briars, well armed with prickly
thorns, which they hold up before the faces of
the wedding party. The groomsman is the
individual appointed to lower these importunate
barriers; which he does by casting among the
mendicants small pieces of money. He executes
his commission with good temper, and very frequently
with liberality; but when the distance
is great, these fetters become so numerous that
his duties grow exceedingly wearisome and expensive.</p>

<p>After the religious ceremony, comes the feast;
which is one of the most incredible things
imaginable. Nothing can give an idea of the
multitude of guests, of all ages, and of each
sex; they form a lively, variegated, and confused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
picture. The tables having been laid out
the previous day, at the coppers, which are
erected in the open air, all the neighbors, and
the invited, who have any pretension to the
culinary art, are ready with advice and assistance.
It is curious to see them, in the blazing
atmosphere of the huge fires, watching enormous
joints of meat and other comestibles cooking in
the numerous and vast utensils; nevertheless,
however zealous they may be, there are few
who do not desert their post when the firing of
guns and the distant sound of the bagpipes announce
the return of the wedding procession.</p>

<p>The newly married couple are at the head of
the train, preceded by pipers, and fiddlers, and
single-stick players, who triumphantly lead the
way; the nearest relatives of the young pair
next follow; then the rest of the guests without
order, rushing on helter-skelter, each in the
varied and picturesque costume of his district;
some on foot, some on horseback, most frequently
two individuals on the same beast, the man
seated upon a stuffed pad which serves as a
saddle, and the wife, with arm around his waist,
seated upon the crupper;&mdash;an every-day sight,
not many years ago, in the rural districts of
England, when roads were bad, and the gig and
taxed-cart uninvented. The mendicants follow
at their heels by hundreds, to share the remnants
of the feast.</p>

<p>As soon as the confusion occasioned by the
arrival of such a multitude has subsided, the
guests place themselves at the tables. These
are formed of rough and narrow planks, supported
by stakes driven into the ground, the
benches constructed after the same fashion;
and they are raised in proportion to the height
of the tables, so that you may have your knees
between your plate and yourself; if, in a real
Breton wedding, you happen to be supplied with
such an article&mdash;for a luxury of this description
has not yet reached very far into Brittany: the
soup is eaten out of a wooden bowl, and the
meat cut up and eaten in the hand, or, as the
phrase goes, "upon the thumb." Every individual,
as a matter of course, carries his own
case or pocket knife; the liquids are served in
rude earthenware, and each drinks out of a cup
apportioned to five or six individuals. It is the
height of civility to hand one's cup to a neighbor,
so that he may assist in emptying it; and
a refusal would be considered extremely rude
and insolent.</p>

<p>The husband and his immediate relatives
are in waiting, and anticipate every one's wants
and wishes&mdash;pressing each to take care of himself:
they themselves share in no part of the
entertainment, save the compliments which
are showered, and the cups of cider and wine
which civility obliges them to accept. After
each course music strikes up, and the whole
assembly rise from the tables. One party gets
up a wrestling-match; the Bretons are as famous
as their cousins in Cornwall at this athletic
game&mdash;or a match at single-stick; another a
foot-race, or a dance; while the dishes are collected
together, and handed to the hungry
groups of mendicants who are seated in adjoining
paddocks. From the tables to rustic games,
reels, gavottes, and jabadoos; then to the tables
again; and they continue in this manner till
midnight announces to the guests that it is time
to retire.</p>

<p>The company having diminished by degrees,
at length leave the groomsman and the bridesmaid
the only strangers remaining, who are
bound to disappear the last, and put the bride and
bridegroom, with due and proper solemnity, to
rest: they then retire singing "Veni Creator."
In some districts they are compelled, by custom,
to watch during the whole night in the bridal
chamber; in others, they hold at the foot of the
bed a lighted candle, between the fingers, and
do not withdraw until the flame has descended
to the palm of the hand. In another locality
the groom's-man is bound during the whole long
night to throw nuts at the husband, who cracks
them, and gives the kernel to his bride to eat.
The festivity which a marriage occasions generally
lasts three days, and, on Friday, the
youthful wife embraces the companions of her
childhood and bids them farewell, as if she never
meant to return. Indeed, from the period of
marriage, a new life commences for the Breton,
whose days of single blessedness have been days
of festivity and freedom; and it would seem
that when once the wedding-ring has been
placed upon the finger, her only business is the
care of her household&mdash;her only delight, the
peace of her domestic hearth.</p>

<h3>[From Chambers's Edinburgh Journal.]</h3>

<h2>JOANNA BAILLIE.</h2>


<p>Joanna Baillie was born in the year
1762, at the manse of Bothwell, in Lanarkshire.
Her father had just been translated from
the parish of Shotts to that of Bothwell; and
on the very first day of the family's removal
into the new manse, while the furniture still lay
tied up in bundles on the floors, Mrs. Baillie
was taken ill, probably from over-fatigue, and
was prematurely brought to bed of twin-daughters,
one of whom died in the birth, and
the other, named Joanna&mdash;after her maternal
uncle, the celebrated John Hunter&mdash;lived for
eighty-nine years, and became the most celebrated
of her race, and one of the most celebrated
women of her time.</p>

<p>Those who like to trace the descent of fine
qualities, will be interested to know that
Joanna's mother&mdash;herself a beautiful and agreeable
woman&mdash;was the only sister of those remarkable
men, William and John Hunter; and
that her father, a clergyman of respectable abilities,
was of the same descent with that Baillie
of Jarviswood who nobly suffered for the religion
and independence of his country.</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Baillie was forty years of age
when she married, she gave birth to five children.
Of these, three grew up: the eldest, Agnes
who still survives; the celebrated Matthew
physician to George III.; and Joanna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>When Joanna was seven years old, her father
removed to Hamilton. There he was colleague
to the Rev. Mr. Miller, father to the well-known
professor of law at Glasgow of that name, whose
daughters were throughout life among Joanna's
most intimate and cherished friends. All that
is known of her before she quitted Bothwell
seems to be, that she was an active, sprightly
child, fond of play, and very unfond of lessons&mdash;the
difficulty of fixing her attention long
enough to enable her to learn the alphabet
having been in her case rather greater than it is
with ordinary children. At twelve years of age,
though still no scholar, she was a clever, lively,
shrewd girl, and even then showed something
of the creative power for which she was afterward
so remarkable. Miss Miller well recollects
being closeted with her and other young companions
for the purpose of hearing her narrate
little stories of her own invention, which she
did in a graphic and amusing manner.</p>

<p>After being seven years at Hamilton, Mr.
Baillie was promoted to the chair of divinity in
the University of Glasgow. There Joanna attended
Miss M'Intosh's boarding-school, and
made some proficiency in the accomplishments
of music and drawing; for both of which she
had a fine taste, though it was never fully cultivated.
A constant residence in the crowded
and smoky town of Glasgow would have proved
very irksome to those accustomed, like the
Baillies, to the sweet, healthful seclusion of a
country manse; but they were never condemned
to it. William Hunter, then accoucheur to
Queen Charlotte, and in good general practice
as a physician, was in possession of the little
family property of Long Calderwood in Lanarkshire;
and being himself confined to London by
his professional duties, he invited his sister and
her family to reside at his house there during
the summer months. Nothing could have been
more agreeable or beneficial to Joanna than this
manner of life, had it continued. Her father
had now a sufficiently large income to enable
him to give his children the full advantage of
the best teaching, and he was most anxious
that they should enjoy it. Unfortunately, he
only survived his removal to Glasgow two
years; and by his premature death, his widow
and family were left not only entirely unprovided
for, but in very involved circumstances. The
living at Hamilton had been too small to admit
of any thing being saved from it; and the expense
of removing, the purchase of furniture
suitable to their new position, the repairing and
furnishing of the house at Long Calderwood,
besides the increased cost of living in a town,
had in combination brought their family into
an expenditure which two years of an enlarged
income were by no means sufficient to meet.
Dr. William Hunter came immediately to their
assistance. He was at that time fast acquiring
the large fortune which enabled him to leave
behind him so noble a monument as the Hunterian
Museum in Glasgow. He generously settled
an adequate income on his sister and her
family, and offered to relieve her mind by entirely
discharging her husband's liabilities. Here the
widow and her high-spirited young people had
the opportunity of manifesting the true delicacy
and respectable pride which have ever distinguished
the family. They carefully avoided
disclosing to their generous relative any thing
more than was unavoidable of these obligations,
preferring, with noble self-denial, and at the
expense of being looked down upon as niggardly
and poor-spirited by neighbors who knew nothing
of their motives, to pay the remainder out of
their moderate income. Such a trait as this is
surely well worth being recorded.</p>

<p>Even after they were clear with the world,
Mrs. Baillie and her daughters continued to live
in the strictest seclusion at Long Calderwood.
Soon after his father's death, young Matthew
obtained a Glasgow exhibition to Oxford; and
having studied successfully there for some years,
joined his uncle William in London, for the purpose
of assisting him in his lectures. John
Hunter, who had been originally intended for a
humbler occupation, had long before this time
been called to London by the successful William&mdash;had
been brought forward by him in the
medical profession&mdash;and had, in a few months,
acquired such a knowledge of anatomy, as to be
capable of demonstrating to the pupils in the
dissecting-room. His health having been impaired
by intense study, he had gone abroad for
a year or two as staff-surgeon, and served in
Portugal. On his return to London, he had devoted
his powerful energies to the study of comparative
anatomy, and before Matthew Baillie
came to London, had erected a menagerie at
Brompton for carrying on that useful branch of
science. By his extraordinary genius, he subsequently
rose to be inspector-general of hospitals
and surgeon-general, and became one of
the most famous men of his age.</p>

<p>Agnes, the elder sister&mdash;Joanna's faithful and
beloved companion through a long life; and to
whom, on entering her seventieth year, she addressed
the exquisite poem of the "Birthday"&mdash;which
no one will ever read unmoved&mdash;was
very early an accomplished girl. Unlike Joanna,
she had always been a diligent, attentive
scholar; and unlike her also, was possessed of
a remarkably retentive memory. In her companionship,
and in the entire leisure of her six
years' seclusion among the picturesque scenery
of Long Calderwood, it may be supposed that
Joanna's powerful intellect would have been
awakened, and her wonderfully fertile imagination
begun to assume some of those varied forms
of truth and beauty which have since impressed
themselves so vividly on the hearts and minds
of her contemporaries. But like the graceful
forms which the eye of the young sculptor has
only yet seen in vision, those divine creations
of her genius, before which the world was afterward
to bow, still slumbered in the marble.
Her genius partook of the slow growth, as well
as the hardy vigor, of the pine-tree of her native
rocks; but it had inherent power to shoot its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
roots deep down in the human heart, and to
spread its branches toward the heavens in green
and enduring beauty. In these years (from her
sixteenth to her twenty-second), the only tendency
she showed toward what afterward became
the master-current of her mind, was in
being a fervent worshiper of Shakspeare. She
carefully studied select passages; delighted in
getting her two favorite young friends&mdash;Miss
Miller, and the lively Miss Graham of Gairbraid&mdash;to
take different parts with her, and would
so spout through a whole play with infinite
satisfaction. Still she was no general student;
and we are doubtful if at any time of her life she
can be considered to have been a <i>great</i> reader.</p>

<p>About a dozen years previous to his death,
which took place in 1783, Dr. William Hunter
had completed his house in Great Windmill-street.
He had attached to it an anatomical
theatre, apartments for lectures and dissections,
and a magnificent room as a museum. At his
death, the use of this valuable museum, which
was destined ultimately to enrich the city of
Glasgow, was bequeathed for the term of twenty
years to his nephew Matthew, who had for some
time past assisted him ably in his anatomical
lectures. Besides this valuable bequest, the
small family property of Long Calderwood was
also left to Matthew Baillie, instead of his uncle,
John Hunter, who was the heir-at-law. William
had taken offense at his brother's marriage&mdash;not
finding fault with his bride, who was an
estimable woman, the sister of Dr., afterward
Sir Everard Home&mdash;but, as it was whimsically
said&mdash;disapproving of a philosopher marrying
at all! But, however this may have been,
young Matthew, with characteristic generosity,
disliking to be enriched at the expense of those
among his kindred who seemed to him to have
a nearer claim, absolutely refused to take advantage
of the bequest. The rejected little
property thus, after all, fell legally to John;
and only on the death of his son and daughter,
a few years ago (without children), descended
to William, the only son of Dr. Matthew Baillie,
as their heir.</p>

<p>Soon after his uncle's death, Matthew, who
had succeeded him as lecturer on anatomy, and
was rising fast in the esteem of his professional
brethren, prevailed on his mother and sisters to
join him in London. Their uncle had left them
all a small independence, and there they lived
most happily with their brother in the house adjoining
the museum, from about the year 1784
to 1791, when he married Miss Denman, daughter
of Dr. Denman, and sister of Lord Denman,
the late admirable lord chief-justice. This marriage
was productive of great happiness to Joanna,
as well as to her brother and the rest of the
family.</p>

<p>Throughout their lives the most tender affection
subsisted among them all. Mrs. Baillie and
her daughters now retired to the country&mdash;at
first a little way up the Thames, then to Hythe,
near Dover; but they did not settle any where
permanently till they located themselves in a
pretty cottage at Hampstead&mdash;that flowery,
airy, charming retreat with which Joanna's
name has now been so long and so intimately
associated. How long she there courted the
muses in secret is not known. Her reserved
nature and Scottish prudence at all events secured
her from making any display of their crude
favors. Toward the end of the century she first
appears to have been quietly feeling her way toward
the light. In sending some books to Scotland,
to her ever-dear friend Miss Graham, she
slipped into the parcel a small volume of poems,
but without a hint as to the authorship. The
poems were chiefly of a light, unassuming, and
merry cast. They were read by Miss Graham,
and others of her early associates&mdash;freely discussed
and criticised among them, and certainly
not much admired. Though light mirth and
humor seem to have been more the characteristics
of her mind then than they were afterward,
and though Miss Graham remarked that
there was a something in the little poems that
brought Joanna to her remembrance, still so
improbable did it seem, that no suspicion of
their true origin suggested itself to any of their
thoughts. The authorship of this little volume
was never claimed by her; but some of the best
poems and songs it contained, which were
afterward published in one of her works, at last
disclosed the secret.</p>

<p>In 1799, her thirty-eighth year, she gave to
the world her first volume of plays on the Passions.
It contained her two great tragedies on
love and on hatred&mdash;"Basil" and "De Montfort;"
and one comedy, also on love&mdash;the
"Tryal." They were prefaced by a long, plausible
introductory discourse, in which she explained
that these formed but a small portion of an
extensive plan she had in view, hitherto unattempted
in any language, and for the accomplishment
of which a lifetime would be limited
enough. Her project we must very shortly describe
as a design to write a series of plays, the
chief object of which should be the delineation
of all the higher passions of the human breast&mdash;each
play exhibiting in the principal character
some one great passion in all the stages
of its development, from its origin to its final
catastrophe; and in which, in order to produce
the strongest moral effect, the aim should be
the expression and delineation of just sentiments
and characteristic truth, rather than of
marvelous incident, novel situation, or beautiful
and sublime thought.</p>

<p>Although published anonymously, this volume
excited an immediate sensation. In spite
of theoretical limitations, it was found to be
as full of original power, and delicate poetical
beauty, as of truth and moral sentiment. Of
course the authorship was keenly inquired into.
As the publication had been negotiated by the
accomplished Mrs. John Hunter&mdash;herself a follower
of the muses, and the author of several
lyrical poems of great sweetness and beauty,
which were set to music by Haydn&mdash;the credit
was at first naturally given to her. But Joanna's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
incognito could not be long preserved; and
the impression already made was deepened by
the discovery, that this skillful anatomist of
the heart of man, who had bodied forth creations
bearing the stamp of lofty intellect and
most original power, was a woman still young,
unlearned, and so inexperienced in the world
that it must have been chiefly to her own imagination
and feeling she owed the materials
which, by the force of her genius, she had thus
so wonderfully combined into striking and lifelike
portraits.</p>

<p>The band of distinguished persons&mdash;poets,
wits, and philosophers&mdash;with which the beginning
of the century was enriched, now crowded
eagerly to welcome to their ranks this new and
highly-gifted sister, and were received by her
with simple but dignified frankness. The gay
and fashionable also would fain have wooed her
to lionize in their fevering circles; but her well-balanced
mind, and intuitive sense of what is
really best and most favorable to human happiness
and progress, seem from the first to have
secured her youthful female heart from being inflated
by the incense offered to her on all sides.
Though touched, and deeply gratified by the
warmly-expressed approbation of those among
her great contemporaries whose applause was
fame, she could not be won from the quiet
healthful privacy of her life to join frequently
even in the brilliant society which now so gladly
claimed her as one of its brightest ornaments.
Equally unspoiled and undistracted, she kept
the even tenor of her way. The tragedies contained
in her first volume&mdash;among the greatest
efforts of her genius&mdash;were undoubtedly written
by her in the fond hope of their being acted.
"To receive the approbation of an audience of
her countrymen," she confesses in the preface,
"would be more grateful to her than any other
praise." Believing that it is in the nature of
man to delight in representations of passion and
character, she regarded the stage, when properly
managed, as an admirable organ for the instruction
of the multitude; and that the poetical
teacher of morality and virtue could not better
employ his high powers than in supplying it
with pieces the tendency of which would be,
while pleasing and amusing, to refine and elevate
the mind. Mrs. Siddons was then in the
very zenith of her power; and it was a glimpse
of that splendid presence&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So queenly, so commanding, and so noble"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as it accidentally flashed upon her in turning
the corner of a street, to which Miss Baillie has
always fondly ascribed her first conception of
the character of the pure, elevated, and noble
Jane de Montfort. In 1800, the tragedy of
"De Montfort" was adapted to the stage by
John Kemble, and brought out at Drury-lane
theatre; and the gratification may well be
imagined with which the high-hearted poetess
must have listened to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thoughts by the soul brought forth in silent joy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Words often muttered by the timid voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tried by the nice ear delicate of choice;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as with their loftiest meanings heightened and
spiritualized, she now heard them poured forth
in the deep eloquent tones of that incomparable
brother and sister!</p>

<p>Her second volume of plays on the Passions
appeared in 1802, and with her name. It contained
four plays: "The Election," a comedy
upon hatred; and two tragedies and a comedy
on ambition&mdash;"Ethwald," in two parts, and the
"Second Marriage." Hitherto the fair authoress
had received almost unqualified praise. She
was now to undergo the other ordeal of almost
unqualified censure. Since the publication of
her first volume, the "Edinburgh Review" had
been established, and its brilliant young editor
had been suddenly, and almost by universal
consent, promoted to the chair, as the first of
critics. Jeffrey's real gentleness of heart, and
lively sensibility to every form of literary beauty
and excellence, are now too generally admitted
to require vindication here; but the lamblike
heart and kindly-indulgent feelings which in his
middle and declining years seemed to warm and
brighten the very atmosphere in which he lived,
were at the beginning of his literary censorship
carefully, and only too successfully, concealed
under the formidable beak and claws, as well as
the keen eye of the eagle.</p>

<p>Starting with the idea that, above all things,
it was his duty to guard against false principles,
the hymn of a seraph would probably have
jarred upon his ear if composed upon what he
supposed to be mistaken rules of art. He regarded
Miss Baillie's project of confining the
interest of every piece to the development of a
single passion as a vicious system, by which her
young and promising genius was likely to be
cabined and confined; and that if such fallacy
in one so well calculated to adorn the field of
literature were met with indulgence, the result
might be to narrow and degrade it. It seemed
to him little better than a return to that barbarism
which could unscrupulously extinguish
the eyesight, that the hearing might be more
acute. His faith was too catholic to brook the
sectarian limitations which were involved in the
theory she had so boldly propounded. He therefore
waged war against the formidable heresy,
cruelly, unsparingly; and if with something of
the heat and petulance of a boy, yet with an
unerring dexterity of aim, and a subtle poignancy
of weapon, that could not fail to inflict
both pain and injury. Gentler practice would
probably have been followed by a better result.
It is certain that Miss Baillie was hurt and
offended by the uncourteous castigation inflicted
on her by her countryman, rather than convinced
by it that her notions were wrong. But the
time happily came when&mdash;with that clairvoyance
which, though it may be denied for a
season, time and experience of life seldom fail
to bestow in full measure upon true genius&mdash;these
two fine spirits were able to read each
other more clearly.</p>

<p>A single volume of miscellaneous plays containing
two tragedies and a comedy by Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Baillie's pen, appeared in 1804. These dramas&mdash;"Rayner,"
"The Country Inn," and "Constantine
Paleologus"&mdash;had been offered singly
to the theatres for representation, and been rejected.
Though full of eloquence, knowledge
of human nature, and tragic power, they were
found, like all her plays, deficient in the lifelike
movement and activity indispensable to that
perfectly successful theatrical effect which, without
an experimental acquaintance with the
whole nature and artifices of the stage has never
been attained to even by the most gifted of
pens.</p>

<p>The first time Miss Baillie revisited her native
country after her name had become known to
fame was in 1808. After exploring with a full
heart the often-recalled scenery of the Clyde, and
the still dearer haunts of the sweet Calder
Water, she passed a couple of months in Edinburgh,
dividing her time between her old friends
Miss Maxwell and Mrs. John Thomson. She
was somewhat changed since these friends had
seen her last. Her manner had become more
silent and reserved. Mere acquaintances, or
strangers who had not the art of drawing forth
the rich stream&mdash;ever ready to flow if the rock
were rightly struck&mdash;found her cold and formidable.
In external appearance the change was
for the better. Her early youth had neither
bloomed with physical nor intellectual beauty;
but now, in her fine, healthy middle life, to the
exquisite neatness of form and limb, the powerful
gray eye, and well-defined, noticeable features
she had always possessed, were added a
graceful propriety of movement, and a fine elevated,
spiritual expression, which are far beyond
mere beauty.</p>

<p>She had now the happiness of being personally
made known to Sir Walter Scott, who had
always been an enthusiastic admirer of her
genius, as she of his. They had been too long
congenial spirits not to become immediately dear,
personal friends. His noble poem of "Marmion,"
which appeared during her stay, was
read aloud by her for the first time to her two
friends Miss Miller and Miss Maxwell. In the
introduction to the third canto occurs that splendid
tribute to her genius which, well-known as it
is, we can not resist quoting once more. The
bard describes himself as advised by a friend,
since he will lend his hours to thriftless rhyme,
to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Restore the ancient tragic line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And emulate the notes that rung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the wild harp, which silent hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By silver Avon's holy shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till twice an hundred years rolled o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she, the bold enchantress, came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fearless hand and heart on flame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the pale willow snatch'd the treasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swept it with a kinder measure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Avon's swans, while rung the grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Montfort's hate and Basil's love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awakening at the inspired strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deem'd their own Shakspeare lived again."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Deeply gratified and touched as she must have
been, the strong-minded poetess was able to read
these exquisite lines unfalteringly to the end,
and only lost her self-possession when one of her
affectionate friends rising, and throwing her
arms round her, burst into tears of delight.</p>

<p>As she did not refuse to go into company,
she could not be long in Edinburgh without
encountering Francis Jeffrey, the foremost man
in the bright train of <i>beaux-esprits</i> which then
adorned the society of the Scottish capital. He
would gladly have been presented to her; and
if she had permitted it, there is little doubt that
in the eloquent flow of his delightful and genial
conversation, enough of the admiration he really
felt for her poetry must have been expressed,
to have softened her into listening at least with
patience to his suggestions for her improvement.
But in vain did the friendly Mrs. Betty Hamilton
(authoress of "The Cottagers of Glenburnie")
beg for leave to present him to her
when they met in her hospitable drawing-room;
and equally in vain were the efforts made by
the good-natured Duchess of Gordon to bring
about an introduction which she knew was
desired at least by one of the parties. It was
civilly but coldly declined by the poetess; and
though the dignified reason assigned was the
propriety of leaving the critic more entirely at
liberty in his future strictures than an <i>acquaintance</i>
might perhaps feel himself, there seems
little reason to doubt that soreness and natural
resentment had something to do with the refusal.</p>

<p>In 1809 her Highland play, the "Family
Legend"&mdash;a tragedy founded on a story of one
of the M'Leans of Appin&mdash;was successfully produced
in the Edinburgh theatre. Sir Walter
Scott, who took a lively interest in its success,
contributed the prologue, and Henry Mackenzie
(the "Man of Feeling") the epilogue. It was
acted with great applause for fourteen successive
nights, and gave occasion for the passage of
many pleasant letters between Sir Walter and
the authoress, afterward published by Mr. Lockhart.
In 1812 followed the third and last
volume of her plays illustrative of the higher
passions of the mind. It contained four plays&mdash;one
in verse and one in prose on fear ("Orra"
and the "Dream"); the "Siege," a comedy on
the same passion; and "The Beacon," a serious
musical drama&mdash;perhaps the most faultless of
Miss Baillie's productions, and generally allowed
to be one of the most exquisite dramatic
poems in the English language. This fresh
attempt, at the end of nine years, to follow out,
against all warning and advice, her narrow and
objectionable system of dramatic art, was certainly
ill-judged. Of course it brought upon
the pertinacious theorist another tremendous
broadside from the provoked reviewer. But
though we can sympathize in a considerable
degree with him in denouncing her whole scheme&mdash;and
more bitterly than ever&mdash;as perverse,
fantastic, and utterly impracticable&mdash;it is not
easy to forgive the accusation so liberally added
as to the execution&mdash;of poverty of incident and
diction, want of individual reality of character,
and the total absence of wit, humor, or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
species of brilliancy. That Miss Baillie's plays
are better suited to the sober perusal of the
closet than the bustle and animation of the
theatre must at once be admitted; but we think
nobody can read even a single volume of these
remarkable works, without finding in it, besides
the good sense, good feeling, and intelligent morality
to which her formidable critic is fretted
into limiting her claims, abundant proof of that
deep and intuitive knowledge of the mystery of
man's nature, which can alone fit its possessor
for the successful delineation of either wayward
passion or noble sacrifice&mdash;of skillful and original
creative power&mdash;of delicate discrimination
of character&mdash;and of a command of simple,
forcible, and eloquent language, that has not
often been equaled, and, perhaps, never surpassed.</p>

<p>But our limits forbid us to linger, and a mere
enumeration of her remaining productions is all
they will permit. This is the less to be regretted,
that our object is rather to give a sketch,
however slight and imperfect, of her long and
honored life, than to attempt a studied analysis
of works to which the world has long ago done
justice. In 1821 were published her "Metrical
Legends of Exalted Character," the subjects of
which were&mdash;"Wallace, the Scottish Chief,"
"Columbus," and "Lady Griseld Baillie."
They are written in irregular verse, avowedly
after the manner of Scott, and are among the
noblest of her productions. Some fine ballads
complete the volume. In 1823 appeared a volume
of "Poetical Miscellanies," which had been
much talked of beforehand. It included, besides
some slight pieces by Mrs. Hemans and
Miss Catherine Fanshaw, Scott's fine dramatic
sketch of "Macduff's Cross." "The Martyr,"
a tragedy on religion, appeared in 1826. It
was immediately translated into the Cingalese
language; and, flattered by the appropriation,
Miss Baillie, in 1828, published another tragedy&mdash;"The
Bride," a story of Ceylon, and dedicated
in particular to the Cingalese. Of the
three volumes of dramas written many years
before, but not published till 1836&mdash;though
they were eagerly welcomed by the public, and
greatly admired as dramatic poems&mdash;only two,
the tragedies of "Henriquez" and "The Separation,"
have ever been acted. These, besides
many charming songs, sung by our greatest
minstrels, and always listened to with delight
by the public, and a small volume of "Fugitive
Verses," complete the long catalogue of her
successful labors. They were collected by
herself, and published, with many additions
and corrections, in the popular form of one
monster volume, only a few weeks before her
death.</p>

<p>To return, for a brief space, to the course of
her life. It was in the autumn of 1820 that
Miss Baillie paid her last visit to Scotland, and
passed those delightful days with Sir Walter
Scott at Abbotsford, the second of which is so
pleasantly given in Mr. Lockhart's life of the
bard. Her friends again perceived a change in
her manners. They had become blander, and
much more cordial. She had probably been
now too long admired and reverently looked up
to, not to understand her own position, and the
encouragement which, essentially unassuming
as she was, would be necessary from her to reassure
the timid and satisfy the proud. She
had magnanimously forgiven and lived down
the unjust severity of her Edinburgh critic, and
now no longer refused to be made personally
known to him. He was presented to her by
their mutual friend, the amiable Dr. Morehead.
They had much earnest and interesting talk
together, and from that hour to the end of their
lives entertained for each other a mutual and
cordial esteem. After this Jeffrey seldom visited
London without indulging himself in a
friendly pilgrimage to the shrine of the secluded
poetess; and it is pleasing to find him writing
of her in the following cordial way in later
years: "<i>London, April</i> 28, 1840.&mdash;I forgot to
tell you that we have been twice out to Hampstead
to hunt out Joanna Baillie, and found her
the other day as fresh, natural, and amiable as
ever&mdash;and as little like a Tragic Muse. Since
old Mrs. Brougham's death, I do not know so
nice an old woman." And again, in January
7, 1842&mdash;"We went to Hampstead, and paid
a very pleasant visit to Joanna Baillie, who is
marvelous in health and spirits, and youthful
freshness and simplicity of feeling, and not a
bit deaf, blind, or torpid."</p>

<p>About two years after her last visit to Scotland,
Miss Baillie had the grief of losing her
brother and beloved friend, Dr. Matthew Baillie,
who, after a life of remarkable activity and
usefulness, died full of honors in 1823. He
left, besides a widow, who long survived him,
a son and daughter, who with their families
have been the source of much delightful and
affectionate interest to the declining years of
the retired sisters. In the composition and
careful revisal of her numerous and varied
works&mdash;in receiving at her modest home the
friends she most loved and respected, a list of
whom would include many of the best-known
names of her time for talent and genius&mdash;in the
active exercise of friendship, benevolence, and
charity&mdash;ever contented with the lot assigned
to her, and as grateful for the enjoyment of
God's blessings as she was submissive to his
painful trials&mdash;her unusually complete life glided
calmly on, and was peacefully closed on the 23d
of February last.</p>

<p>It will be easily believed, that in spite of all
the natural modesty and reserve of Miss Baillie's
character, the impression made by the appearance
of one so highly gifted on those who had
the happiness of being admitted to her intimacy,
was neither slight nor evanescent. "Dear,
venerable Joanna!" writes one of those, "I wish
I could, for my own or others' benefit, recall,
and in any way fix, the features of your countenance
and mind! The ever-thoughtful brow&mdash;the
eye that in old age still dilated with expression,
or was suffused with a tear. I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
felt afraid of her. How could I, having experienced
nothing but the most constant kindness
and indulgence? I had heard of the
'awful stillness of the Hampstead drawing-room;'
and when I first saw her in her own
quiet home (she must have been then bordering
on seventy, and I on twenty), I remember likening
myself to the devil in Milton. I felt 'how
awful goodness is&mdash;and virtue in her shape,
how lovely!' One could not help feeling a
constant reverence for her worth, even more
than an admiration of her intellectual gifts.
There was something, indeed, in her appearance
that quite contrasted with one's ideas of authorship,
which made one forget her works in her
presence&mdash;nay, almost wonder if the neat, precise
old maid before one could really be the
same person who had painted the warm passion
of a Basil, or soared to and sympathized with
the ambition of a Mohammed or a Paleologus."</p>

<p>In a little tract, published about twenty
years before her death, she indicates her religious
creed. After studying the Scriptures carefully&mdash;examining
the gospels and epistles, and
comparing them with one another, which she
thinks is all the unlearned can do&mdash;she faithfully
sets down every passage relating to the
divinity and mission of Christ; and, looking to
the bearing of the whole, is able to rest her
mind upon the Arian doctrine, which supposes
Him to be "a most highly-gifted Being, who
was with God before the creation of the world,
and by whose agency it probably was created,
by power derived from Almighty God." That
she was no bigoted sectarian in religion, whatever
she may once have been in poetry, is
pleasingly shown by the following sentences.
They occur in a letter to her ever esteemed and
admired friend Mrs. Siddons, to whom she had
sent a copy of this tract. They do honor to
both the ladies:&mdash;"You have treated my little
book very handsomely, and done all that I
wish people to do in regard to it; for you have
read the passages from Scripture, I am sure,
with attention, and have considered them with
candor. That after doing so, your opinions, on
the main point, should be different from mine,
is no presumption that either of us is in the
wrong, or that our humble, sincere faith, though
different, will not be equally accepted by the
great father and master of us all. Indeed, this
tract was less intended for Christians, whose
faith is already fixed, than for those who, supposing
certain doctrines to be taught in Scripture
(which do not, when taken in one general
view, appear to be taught there), and which
they can not bring their minds to agree to,
throw off revealed religion altogether. No
part of your note, my dear madam, has pleased
me more than that short parenthesis ('for I
still hold fast my own faith without wavering'),
and long may this be the case! The fruits
of that faith, in the course of your much-tried
and honorable life, are too good to allow any
one to find fault with it."</p>

<h2>A VISIT AT MR. WEBSTER'S.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></h2>


<p>We have been much charmed with our visit
to Green Harbor, Marshfield, the beautiful
domain of Mr. Webster. It is a charming and
particularly enjoyable place, almost close to the
sea. The beach here is something marvelous,
eight miles in breadth, and of splendid, hard,
floor-like sand, and when this is covered by the
rolling Atlantic, the waves all but come up to
the neighboring green, grassy fields. Very high
tides cover them.</p>

<p>This house is very prettily fitted up. It
strikes me as being partly in the English and
partly in the French style, exceedingly comfortable,
and with a number of remarkably pretty
drawing-rooms opening into one another, which
always is a judicious arrangement I think; it
makes a party agreeable and unformal. There
are a variety of pictures and busts by American
artists, and some of them are exceedingly good.
There is a picture in the chief drawing-room of
Mr. Webster's gallant son, who was killed in the
Mexican war. The two greatest of America's
statesmen each lost a son in that war, Mr. Clay
and Mr. Webster. There is also a fine picture
of Mr. Webster himself, which, however, though
a masterly painting, does not do justice to the
distinguished original. It was executed some
years ago; but I really think it is not so handsome
as the great statesman is now, with his
Olympus-like brow, on which are throned such
divinities of thought, and with that wonderful
countenance of might and majesty.</p>

<p>The dining-room here is a charming apartment,
with all its windows opening to the
ground, looking on the garden; and it is deliciously
cool, protected from the sun by the
overshadowing masses of foliage of the most
magnificent weeping (American) elms. These
colossal trees stand just before the house, and
are pre-eminently beautiful: they seem to unite
in their own gigantic persons the exquisite and
exceeding grace of the weeping willow, with the
strength and grandeur of the towering elm. I
was told a curious fact last night. Every where,
through the length and breadth of the States, the
sycamore trees this year are blighted and dying.</p>

<p>The walls of the dining-room are adorned
chiefly with English engravings, among which
there is one of my father. My bed-room is profusely
decorated with prints of different English
country houses and castles. The utmost good
taste and refinement are perceptible in the arrangements
of the house, and a most enchanting
place of residence it is. All the domestics
of the house are colored persons, which is very
seldom indeed the case in this part of the United
States. Mr. Webster tells me he considers
them the best possible servants, much attached,
contented, and grateful, and he added, he would
"fearlessly trust them with <i>untold gold</i>." They
certainly must be good ones, to judge by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
exquisite neatness and order of every thing in
the establishment.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster's farm here consists of one thousand
five hundred acres: he has a hundred head
of cattle.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Webster has been a good deal in India,
and he was mentioning the other evening that
he was struck, in several of the English schools
in that country, by the tone of some political
lessons that were taught there. For instance,
with regard to freedom and representation of
the people, &amp;c.; the natives were forcibly reminded
of their own unrepresented state, by
questions bearing on the subject&mdash;the United
States being instanced as an example of almost
universal suffrage; Great Britain itself of a less
extensive elective franchise; France, of whatever
France was then; and Hindostan <i>especially</i>
pointed out as having nothing of the kind, as
if they really wished to make the poor Hindoos
discontented with their present state. To be
sure they might as well go to Persia and Turkey
for their examples. Mr. F. Webster seemed to
think the Hindoos were beginning a little to
turn their thoughts to such political subjects.</p>

<p>While we were at dinner a day or two ago,
a new guest, who had arrived rather late from
New York, walked in, being announced as a
general. He was a very military-looking man,
indeed, with a formidable pair of mustaches.
Some turn in the conversation reminding me of
the Mexican war, I asked if General &mdash;&mdash; had
served in Mexico. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; laughed, and told
me he was in the militia, and had never smelt
powder in his life.</p>

<p>What enterprising travelers American ladies
sometimes are! My Atlantic-crossing performances
seem very little in comparison with some
of their expeditions. It would not surprise me
that any who have ever gone to settle in the
far-off portions of the country, and been doomed
to undergo such rugged experiences as those described
in the American work (by a lady) called
"A New Home, Who'll Follow?" should laugh
at hardships and discomforts which might reasonably
deter less seasoned and experienced
travelers; but it must be a very different case
with those habituated only to refinements and
luxuries. Mr. Webster had told me he had expected
for some little time past the arrival of a
lady, a relative of his, who had lately left China
for the United States; she was to leave her
husband in the Celestial flowery land, her intention
being, I believe, to see her relatives and
friends at home, and then to rejoin him in the
course of some months in China.</p>

<p>Like the gallant chieftain spoken of before,
he arrived late, and during dinner the doors
were thrown open and "Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;, from
China," was announced. She came in, and
met her relatives and friends, as quietly as if
she had merely made a "petite promenade de
quinze jours" (as the French boasted they should
do when they went to besiege Antwerp). She
seated herself at table, when a few questions
were asked relative to her voyage.</p>

<p>"Had you a good passage?"</p>

<p>"Very&mdash;altogether."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"About one hundred and three days" (I think
this is correct, but I can not answer to a day).</p>

<p>"Pleasant companions?"</p>

<p>"Very much so, and with books the time
passed very agreeably."</p>

<p>All this was as quietly discussed as if the
passage had been from Dover to Boulogne, and
the length of the time of absence a fortnight.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster was good enough to drive me
out yesterday, and a most splendid drive we
had. At one part, from a rather high eminence,
we had a glorious panoramic view: it was really
sublime: ocean, forest, hill, valley, promontory,
river, field, glade, and hollow, were spread before
us; altogether they formed a truly magnificent
prospect. One almost seemed to be looking into
boundless space. We paused at this spot a little
while to admire the beautiful scene. How
meet a companion the giant Atlantic seemed for
that mighty mind, to some of whose noble sentiments
I had just been listening with delight
and veneration, and yet how far beyond the
widest sweep of ocean, is the endless expanse
of the immortal intellect&mdash;time-overcoming&mdash;creation-compelling!</p>

<p>However, while I was thus up in the clouds,
they (condescendingly determining, I suppose,
to return my call) suddenly came down upon
us, and unmercifully. St. Swithin! what a rain
it was! The Atlantic is a beautiful object to
look at, but when either he, or some cousin-german
above, takes it into his head to act the
part of shower-bath-extraordinary to you, it is
not so pleasant. My thoughts immediately fled
away from ocean (except the <i>descending</i> one),
forest, hill, dale, and all the circumjacent scenery,
to centre ignominiously on my bonnet, to
say nothing of the tip of my nose, which was
drenched and drowned completely in a half
second. My vail&mdash;humble defense against the
fury of the elements!&mdash;accommodated its dripping
self to the features of my face, like the
black mask of some desperate burglar, driven
against it, also, by the wind, that blew a "few,"
I can assure the reader.</p>

<p>How Mr. Webster contrived to drive, I know
not, but drive he did, at a good pace too, for
"after us," indeed, was "the deluge;" I could
scarcely see him; a wall of water separated us,
but ever and anon I heard faintly, through the
hissing, and splashing, and lashing, and pattering
of the big rain, his deep, sonorous voice,
recommending me to keep my cloak well about
me, which no mortal cloak of any spirit will
ever allow you to do at such needful moments&mdash;not
it! "My kingdom for a pin."</p>

<p>When we arrived at Green Harbour, we found
Mrs. Webster very anxious for the poor rain-beaten
wayfarers. She took every kind care of
me, and, except a very slight <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of a cold,
the next morning, I did not suffer any inconvenience.
Mr. Webster had complained of not
being very well before (I think a slight attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of hay-asthma), but I was glad to meet him
soon afterward at dinner, not at all the worse
for the tempestuous drive; and for my part, I
could most cordially thank him for the glorious
panorama he had shown me, and the splendid
drive through what seemed almost interminable
woods: and (since we had got safely through
it), I was not sorry to have witnessed the very
excellent imitation of the Flood which had been
presented before (and some of it into) my astonished
eyes. Mr. Webster told me the drive
through the woods would have been extended,
but for the rain, ten miles!</p>

<p>I can not describe to you the almost adoration
with which Mr. Webster is regarded in
New England. The newspapers chronicle his
every movement, and constantly contain anecdotes
respecting him, and he invariably is treated
with the greatest respect by everybody, and,
in fact, his intellectual greatness seems all but
worshiped. Massachusetts boasts, with a commendable
pride and exultation, that he is one
of her children. A rather curious anecdote has
been going the round of the papers lately. It
appears Mr. Webster was at Martha's Vineyard
a short time ago, and he drove up to the door
of the principal hotel, at Edgartown, the capital,
accompanied by some of his family, and
attended, as usual, by his colored servants.
Now, it must be observed that Mr. Webster has
a swarthy, almost South-Spanish complexion,
and when he put his head out of the window
and inquired for apartments, the keeper of the
hotel, casting dismayed glances, first at the
domestics of different shades of sable and mahogany,
and then at the fine dark face of Mr.
Webster, excused himself from providing them
with accommodation, declaring he made it a
rule never to receive any <i>colored persons</i>. (This
in New England, if the tale be true!). The
great statesman and his family were about to
seek for accommodation elsewhere&mdash;thinking
the hotel-keeper alluded to his servants&mdash;when
the magical name of "glorious Dan" becoming
known, mine host, penitent and abashed, after
profuse apologies, intreated him to honor his
house with his presence. "All's well that ends
well."</p>

<p>One can not wonder at the Americans' extreme
admiration of the genius and the statesman-like
qualities of their distinguished countryman,
his glorious and electrifying eloquence,
his great powers of ratiocination, his solid judgment,
his stores of knowledge, and his large and
comprehensive mind&mdash;a mind of that real expansion
and breadth which, heaven knows, too
few public men can boast of.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE JEWELED WATCH.</h2>


<p>Among the many officers who, at the close
of the Peninsular war, retired on half-pay,
was Captain Dutton of the &mdash;th regiment. He
had lately married the pretty, portionless daughter
of a deceased brother officer; and filled with
romantic visions of rural bliss and "love in a
cottage," the pair, who were equally unskilled
in the practical details of housekeeping, fancied
they could live in affluence, and enjoy all the
luxuries of life, on the half-pay which formed
their sole income.</p>

<p>They took up their abode near a pleasant
town in the south of England, and for a time
got on pretty well; but when at the end of the
first year a sweet little boy made his appearance,
and at the end of the second an equally
sweet little girl, they found that nursemaids,
baby-linen, doctors, and all the etceteras appertaining
to the introduction and support of these
baby-visitors, formed a serious item in their
yearly expenditure.</p>

<p>For a while they struggled on without falling
into debt; but at length their giddy feet slipped
into that vortex which has engulfed so many,
and their affairs began to assume a very gloomy
aspect. About this time an adventurer named
Smith, with whom Captain Dutton became
casually acquainted, and whose plausible manners
and appearance completely imposed on the
frank, unsuspecting soldier, proposed to him a
plan for insuring, as he represented it, a large and
rapid fortune. This was to be effected by embarking
considerable capital in the manufacture
of some new kind of spirit-lamps, which Smith
assured the captain would, when once known,
supersede the use of candles and oil-lamps
throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>To hear him descant on the marvelous virtues
and money-making qualities of his lamp,
one would be inclined to take him for the lineal
descendant of Aladdin, and inheritor of that
scampish individual's precious heirloom. Our
modern magician, however, candidly confessed
that he still wanted the "slave of the lamp,"
or, in other words, ready money, to set the invention
a-going; and he at length succeeded in
persuading the unlucky captain to sell out of
the army, and invest the price of his commission
in this luminous venture. If Captain Dutton
had refused to pay the money until he should
be able to pronounce correctly the name of the
invention, he would have saved his cash, at the
expense probably of a semi-dislocation of his
jaws; for the lamp rejoiced in an eight syllabled
title, of which each vocable belonged to a
different tongue&mdash;the first being Greek, the
fourth Syriac, and the last taken from the
aboriginal language of New Zealand; the intervening
sounds believed to be respectively akin
to Latin, German, Sanscrit, and Malay. Notwithstanding,
however, this <i>prestige</i> of a name,
the lamp was a decided failure: its light was
brilliant enough; but the odor it exhaled in
burning was so overpowering, so suggestive of
an evil origin, so every way abominable, that
those adventurous purchasers who tried it once,
seldom submitted their olfactory nerves to a
second ordeal. The sale and manufacture of
the lamp and its accompanying spirit were carried
on by Mr. Smith alone in one of the chief
commercial cities of England, he having kindly
arranged to take all the trouble off his partner's
hands, and only requiring him to furnish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
necessary funds. For some time the accounts
of the business transmitted to Captain Dutton
were most flourishing, and he and his gentle
wife fondly thought they were about to realize
a splendid fortune for their little ones; but at
length they began to feel anxious for the arrival
of the cent.-per-cent. profits which had been
promised, but which never came; and Mr.
Smith's letters suddenly ceasing, his partner
one morning set off to inspect the scene of
operations.</p>

<p>Arrived at L&mdash;&mdash;, he repaired to the street
where the manufactory was situated, and found
it shut up! Mr. Smith had gone off to America,
considerably in debt to those who had been
foolish enough to trust him; and leaving more
rent due on the premises than the remaining
stock in trade of the unpronounceable lamp
would pay. As to the poor ex-captain, he returned
to his family a ruined man.</p>

<p>But strength is often found in the depths of
adversity, courage in despair; and both our
hero and his wife set resolutely to work to support
themselves and their children. Happily
they owed no debts. On selling out, Captain
Dutton had honorably paid every farthing he
owed in the world before intrusting the remainder
of his capital to the unprincipled Smith;
and now this upright conduct was its own reward.</p>

<p>He wrote a beautiful hand, and while seeking
some permanent employment, earned a
trifle occasionally by copying manuscripts, and
engrossing in an attorney's office. His wife
worked diligently with her needle; but the care
of a young family, and the necessity of dispensing
with a servant, hindered her from adding
much to their resources. Notwithstanding their
extreme poverty, they managed to preserve a
decent appearance, and to prevent even their
neighbors from knowing the straits to which
they were often reduced. Their little cottage
was always exquisitely clean and neat; and
the children, despite of scanty clothing, and
often insufficient food, looked as they were,
the sons and daughters of a gentleman.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Dutton's pride to preserve the
respectable appearance of her husband's wardrobe;
and often did she work till midnight at
turning his coat and darning his linen, that he
might appear as usual among his equals. She
often urged him to visit his former acquaintances,
who had power to befriend him, and
solicit their interest in obtaining some permanent
employment; but the soldier, who was as
brave as a lion when facing the enemy, shrank
with the timidity of a girl from exposing himself
to the humiliation of a refusal, and could
not bear to confess his urgent need. He had
too much delicacy to press his claims; he was
too proud to be importunate; and so others
succeeded where he failed.</p>

<p>It happened that the general under whom he
had served, and who had lost sight of him since
his retirement from the service, came to spend
a few months at the watering-place near which
the Duttons resided, and hired for the season a
handsome furnished house. Walking one morning
on the sands, in a disconsolate mood, our
hero saw, with surprise, his former commander
approaching; and with a sudden feeling of
false shame, he tried to avoid a recognition.
But the quick eye of General Vernon was not
to be eluded, and intercepting him with an
outstretched hand, he exclaimed&mdash;"What, Dutton!
is that you? It seems an age since we
met. Living in this neighborhood, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, general; I have been living here since
I retired from the service."</p>

<p>"And you sold out, I think&mdash;to please the
mistress, I suppose, Dutton? Ah! these ladies
have a great deal to answer for. Tell Mrs.
Dutton I shall call on her some morning, and
read her a lecture for taking you from us."</p>

<p>Poor Dutton's look of confusion, as he pictured
the general's visit surprising his wife in
the performance of her menial labors, rather
surprised the veteran; but its true cause did
not occur to him. He had had a great regard
for Dutton, considering him one of the best and
bravest officers under his command, and was
sincerely pleased at meeting him again; so,
after a ten minutes' colloquy, during the progress
of which the ex-soldier, like a war-horse
who pricks up his ears at the sound of the
trumpet, became gay and animated, as old
associations of the camp and field came back
on him, the general shook him heartily by the
hand, and said&mdash;"You'll dine with me to-morrow,
Dutton, and meet a few of your old friends?
Come, I'll take no excuse; you must not turn
hermit on our hands."</p>

<p>At first Dutton was going to refuse, but on
second thoughts accepted the invitation, not
having, indeed, any good reason to offer for
declining it. Having taken leave of the general,
therefore, he proceeded toward home, and
announced their rencontre to his wife. She,
poor woman, immediately took out his well-saved
suit, and occupied herself in repairing, as
best she might, the cruel ravages of time; as
well as in starching and ironing an already
snowy shirt to the highest degree of perfection.</p>

<p>Next day, in due time, he arrived at General
Vernon's handsome temporary dwelling, and received
a cordial welcome. A dozen guests, civilians
as well as soldiers, sat down to a splendid
banquet. After dinner, the conversation happened
to turn on the recent improvements in arts
and manufactures; and comparisons were drawn
between the relative talent for invention displayed
by artists of different countries. Watch-making
happening to be mentioned as one of
the arts which had during late years been wonderfully
improved, the host desired his valet to
fetch a most beautiful little watch, a perfect
<i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of workmanship, which he had
lately purchased in Paris; and which was less
valuable for its richly jeweled case, than for the
exquisite perfection of the mechanism it enshrined.
The trinket passed from hand to
hand, and was greatly admired by the guests;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
then the conversation turned on other topics,
and many subjects were discussed, until they
adjourned to the drawing-room to take coffee.</p>

<p>After sitting there a while, the general suddenly
recollected his watch, and ringing for his
valet, desired him to take it from the dining-room
table, where it had been left, and restore
it to its proper place. In a few moments the
servant returned, looking somewhat frightened:
he could not find the watch. General Vernon,
surprised, went himself to search, but was not
more fortunate.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, sir, you or one of the company
may have carried it by mistake into the drawing-room?"</p>

<p>"I think not; but we will try."</p>

<p>Another search, in which all the guests joined,
but without avail.</p>

<p>"What I fear," said the general, "is that
some one by chance may tread upon and break
it."</p>

<p>General Vernon was a widower, and this
costly trinket was intended as a present to his
only child, a daughter, who had lately married
a wealthy baronet.</p>

<p>"We will none of us leave this room until it
is found!" exclaimed one of the gentlemen
with ominous emphasis.</p>

<p>"That decision," said a young man, who
was engaged that night to a ball, "might quarter
us on our host for an indefinite time. I
propose a much more speedy and satisfactory
expedient: let us all be searched."</p>

<p>This suggestion was received with laughter
and acclamations; and the young man, presenting
himself as the first victim, was searched
by the valet, who, for the nonce, enacted the
part of custom-house officer. The general, who
at first opposed this piece of practical pleasantry,
ended by laughing at it; and each new inspection
of pockets produced fresh bursts of mirth.
Captain Dutton alone took no share in what
was going on: his hand trembled, his brow
darkened, and he stood as much apart as possible.
At length his turn came; the other
guests had all displayed the contents of their
pockets, so with one accord, and amid renewed
laughter, they surrounded him, exclaiming that
he must be the guilty one, as he was the last.
The captain, pale and agitated, muttered some
excuses, unheard amid the uproar.</p>

<p>"Now for it, Johnson!" cried one to the
valet.</p>

<p>"Johnson, we're watching you!" said another;
"produce the culprit."</p>

<p>The servant advanced; but Dutton crossing
his arms on his breast, declared in an agitated
voice, that, except by violence, no one should
lay a hand on him. A very awkward silence
ensued, which the general broke by saying:
"Captain Dutton is right; this child's play has
lasted long enough. I claim exemption for him
and for myself."</p>

<p>Dutton, trembling and unable to speak, thanked
his kind host by a grateful look, and then
took an early opportunity of withdrawing;
General Vernon did not make the slightest remark
on his departure, and the remaining guests,
through politeness, imitated his reserve; but
the mirth of the evening was gone, every face
looked anxious, and the host himself seemed
grave and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Captain Dutton spent some time in wandering
restlessly on the sands before he returned
home. It was late when he entered the cottage,
and his wife could not repress an exclamation
of affright when she saw his pale and troubled
countenance.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" cried she.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied her husband, throwing
himself on a chair, and laying a small packet
on the table. "You have cost me very dear,"
he said, addressing it. In vain did his wife try
to soothe him, and obtain an explanation.
"Not now, Jane," he said; "to-morrow we
shall see. To-morrow I will tell you all."</p>

<p>Early next morning he went to General
Vernon's house. Although he walked resolutely,
his mind was sadly troubled. How could he
present himself? In what way would he be
received? How could he speak to the general
without risking the reception of some look or
word which he could never pardon? The very
meeting with Johnson was to be dreaded.</p>

<p>He knocked; another servant opened the
door, and instantly gave him admission. "<i>This</i>
man, at all events," he thought, "knows nothing
of what has passed." Will the general receive
him? Yes; he is ushered into his dressing-room.
Without daring to raise his eyes, the
poor man began to speak in a low hurried voice.</p>

<p>"General Vernon, you thought my conduct
strange last night; and painful and humiliating
as its explanation will be, I feel it due to you
and to myself to make it&mdash;"</p>

<p>His auditor tried to speak, but Dutton went
on, without heeding the interruption. "My
misery is at its height: that is my only excuse.
My wife and our four little ones are actually
starving!"</p>

<p>"My friend!" cried the general with emotion.
But Dutton proceeded.</p>

<p>"I can not describe my feelings yesterday
while seated at your luxurious table. I thought
of my poor Jane, depriving herself of a morsel
of bread to give it to her baby; of my little
pale thin Annie, whose delicate appetite rejects
the coarse food which is all we can give her;
and in an evil hour I transferred two <i>pat&eacute;s</i> from
my plate to my pocket, thinking they would
tempt my little darling to eat. I should have
died of shame had these things been produced
from my pocket, and your guests and servant
made witnesses of my cruel poverty. Now,
general, you know all; and but for the fear of
being suspected by you of a crime, my distress
should never have been known!"</p>

<p>"A life of unblemished honor," replied his
friend, "has placed you above the reach of
suspicion; besides, look here!" And he showed
the missing watch. "It is I," continued he,
"who must ask pardon of you all. In a fit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
absence I had dropped it into my waistcoat
pocket, where, in Johnson's presence, I discovered
it while undressing."</p>

<p>"If I had only known!" murmured poor
Dutton.</p>

<p>"Don't regret what has occurred," said the
general, pressing his hand kindly. "It has been
the means of acquainting me with what you
should never have concealed from an old friend,
who, please God, will find some means to serve
you."</p>

<p>In a few days Captain Dutton received another
invitation to dine with the general. All
the former guests were assembled, and their
host, with ready tact, took occasion to apologize
for his strange forgetfulness about the watch.
Captain Dutton found a paper within the folds
of his napkin: it was his nomination to an
honorable and lucrative post, which insured
competence and comfort to himself and his
family.</p>

<h2>NEW PROOF OF THE EARTH'S ROTATION.</h2>


<p>"The earth does move notwithstanding,"
whispered Galileo, leaving the dungeon
of the Inquisition: by which he meant his
friends to understand, that if the earth did
move, the fact would remain so in spite of his
punishment. But a less orthodox assembly
than the conclave of Cardinals might have been
staggered by the novelty of the new philosophy.
According to Laplace, the apparent diurnal
phenomena of the heavens would be the same
either from the revolution of the sun or the
earth; and more than one reason made strongly
in favor of the prevalent opinion that the earth,
not the sun, was stationary. First, it was most
agreeable to the impression of the senses; and
next, to disbelieve in the fixity of the solid globe,
was not only to eject from its pride of place our
little planet, but to disturb the long-cherished
sentiment that we ourselves are the centre&mdash;the
be-all and end-all of the universe. However,
the truth will out; and this is its great distinction
from error, that while every new discovery
adds to its strength, falsehood is weakened and
at last driven from the field.</p>

<p>That the earth revolves round the sun, and
rotates on its polar axis, have long been the
settled canons of our system. But the rotation
of the earth has been rendered <i>visible</i> by a practical
demonstration, which has drawn much attention
in Paris, and is beginning to excite interest
in this country. The inventor is M. Foucault;
and the following description has
been given of the mode of proof:</p>

<p>"At the centre of the dome of the Panth&eacute;on
a fine wire is attached, from which a sphere of
metal, four or five inches in diameter, is suspended
so as to hang near the floor of the building.
This apparatus is put in vibration after
the manner of a pendulum. Under and concentrical
with it, is placed a circular table, some
twenty feet in diameter, the circumference of
which is divided into degrees, minutes, &amp;c., and
the divisions numbered. Now, supposing the
earth to have the diurnal motion imputed to it,
and which explains the phenomena of day and
night, the plane in which this pendulum vibrates
will not be affected by this motion, but the table
over which the pendulum is suspended will continually
change its position in virtue of the diurnal
motion, so as to make a complete revolution
round its centre. Since, then, the table thus
revolves, and the pendulum which vibrates over
it does not revolve, the consequence is, that a
line traced upon the table by a point projecting
from the bottom of the ball will change its direction
relatively to the table from minute to
minute and from hour to hour, so that if such
point were a pencil, and that paper were spread
upon the table, the course formed by this pencil
would form a system of lines radiating from the
centre of the table. The practiced eye of a correct
observer, especially if aided by a proper
optical instrument, may actually see the motion
which the table has in common with the earth
under the pendulum between two successive vibrations.
It is, in fact, apparent that the ball,
or rather the point attached to the bottom of
the ball, does not return precisely to the same
point of the circumference of the table after two
successive vibrations. Thus is rendered visible
the motion which the table has in common with
the earth."</p>

<p>Crowds are said to flock daily to the Panth&eacute;on
to witness this interesting experiment. It has
been successfully repeated at the Russell Institution,
and preparations are being made in some
private houses for the purpose. A lofty staircase
or room twelve or fourteen feet high would
suffice; but the dome of St. Paul's, or, as suggested
by Mr. Sylvestre in the <i>Times</i>, the transept
of the Crystal Palace, offers the most eligible
site. The table would make its revolution
at the rate of 15&deg; per hour. Explanations,
however, will be necessary from lecturers and
others who give imitations of M. Foucault's
ingenuity, to render it intelligible to those unacquainted
with mathematics, or with the laws
of gravity and spherical motion. For instance,
it will not be readily understood by every one
why the pendulum should vibrate in the same
plane, and not partake of the earth's rotation
in common with the table; but this could be
<i>shown</i> with a bullet suspended by a silk-worm's
thread. Next, the apparent horizontal revolution
of the table round its centre will be incomprehensible
to many, as representative of its
own and the earth's motion round its axis.
Perhaps Mr. Wyld's colossal globe will afford
opportunities for simplifying these perplexities
to the unlearned.</p>

<p>The pendulum is indeed an extraordinary instrument,
and has been a useful handmaid to
science. We are familiar with it as the time-regulator
of our clocks, and the ease with which
they may be made to go faster or slower by adjusting
its length. But neither this nor the
Panth&eacute;on elucidation constitutes its sole application.
By it the latitude maybe approximately
ascertained, the density of the earth's strata in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
different places, and its elliptical eccentricity of
figure. The noble Florentine already quoted was
its inventor; and it is related of Galileo, while
a boy, that he was the first to observe how the
height of the vaulted roof of a church might be
measured by the times of the vibration of the
chandeliers suspended at different altitudes.
Were the earth perforated from London to our
antipodes, and the air exhausted, a ball dropped
through would at the centre acquire a velocity
sufficient to carry it to the opposite side, whence
it would again descend, and so oscillate forward
and backward from one side of the globe's surface
to the other in the manner of a pendulum.
Very likely the Cardinals of the Vatican would
deem this heresy, or "flat blasphemy."</p>

<p>To clearly appreciate the following popular
explanation, it will be necessary for the reader to
convince himself of one property of the pendulum,
viz., that of constantly vibrating in the
same plane. Let it be imagined that a pendulum
is suspended over a common table, <i>the parts
bearing the pendulum being also attached to the
table</i>. Suppose, also, that the table can move
freely on its centre like a music-stool: the pendulum
being put in motion will continue to
move in the same plane between the eye and
any object on the walls of the room, although
the table is made to revolve, and during one
revolution will have <i>radiated</i> through the whole
circumference. A few moments' reflection are
only necessary to prove this.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill-1851-june-illo_22.jpg" width="400" height="322" alt="FIGURE 1. Rotation of the earth&mdash;Diagram 1" title="" />
<span class="caption">FIGURE 1.</span>
</div>

<p>The above figure represents a plane or table
on the top of a globe, or at the north pole of
the earth. To this table are fixed two rods,
from which is suspended a pendulum, moving
freely in any direction. The pendulum is made
to vibrate in the path <i>a b</i>; it will continue to
vibrate in this line, and have no apparent circular
or angular motion until the globe revolves,
when it will appear to have vibrated through
the entire circle, <i>to an object fixed on the table
and moving with it</i>. It is scarcely necessary to
say the circular motion of the pendulum is only
apparent, since it is the table that revolves&mdash;the
apparent motion of the pendulum in a circle
being the same as the apparent motion of
the land to a person on board ship, or the recession
of the earth to a person in a balloon.
The pendulum vibrates always in the same
plane at the pole, and in planes parallel to each
other at any intermediate point.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill-1851-june-illo_23.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="FIG. 2. Rotation of the earth&mdash;Diagram 2" title="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. 2 represents the earth or a globe revolving
once in twenty-four hours on its axis (<span class="smcap">s n</span>).
It is divided, on its upper half, by lines parallel
to each other, representing the latitudes 60 degrees,
30 degrees, and the equator, where the
latitude is nothing. The lines <i>a b</i>, at 90, 60,
30, and 0 represent the planes of those latitudes;
or, in more familiar terms, tables, over which a
pendulum is supposed to vibrate, and moving
with them in their revolutions round the axis
(<span class="smcap">s n</span>). This being clearly understood, the next
object is to show how the pendulum moves
round the tables, for each of the latitudes; also
to show the gradual diminution of its circular motion
as it approaches the equator (<span class="smcap">e e</span>), where,
as was before observed, the latitude is nothing.</p>

<p>A pendulum vibrating over the plane, or table
(<i>a b</i>), on the top of the globe, has been already
shown (by Fig. 1) to go round the entire
circle in twenty-four hours; or to have an angular
velocity of 90, or quarter of a circle, in six
hours. The plane (<i>a b</i>), at 60, has an inclination
to the axis (<span class="smcap">s n</span>), which will cause a pendulum
vibrating over it to move through its
circumference at a diminished rate. This will
be shown by reference to the figure. The globe
is revolving in the direction from left to right;
the pendulum is vibrating over the line <i>a b</i>,
which, at all times during its course, is parallel
with the first path of vibration. The plane may
now be supposed to have moved during six hours,
or to have gone through a quarter of an entire revolution,
equal to 90; but the pendulum has only
moved from <i>c</i> to <i>a</i>, considerably less than 90.
Again, if the plane is carried another six hours,
making together 180, the Figure shows the pendulum
to have moved only from <i>c</i> to <i>a</i>, considerably
less than 180. The same remarks apply to
the lower latitude of 30, where, it will be seen, the
circular, or angular motion of the pendulum, is
considerably slower than in the latitude of 60, continuing
to diminish, until it becomes nothing at
the equator, where it is clearly shown by the Figure
to be always parallel to itself, and constant
over its path of vibration through the entire circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<h2>ADVENTURE WITH A GRIZZLY BEAR.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></h2>


<p>I now took a long farewell of the horses, and
turned northward, selecting a line close in
by the base of the hills, going along at an improved
pace, with a view of reaching the trading-post
the same night; but stopping in a
gully to look for water, I found a little pool,
evidently scratched out by a bear, as there
were foot-prints and claw-marks about it; and
I was aware instinct prompts that brute where
water is nearest the surface, when he scratches
until he comes to it. This was one of very
large size, the foot-mark behind the toes being
full nine inches; and although I had my misgivings
about the prudence of a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with
a great grizzly bear, still the "better part of
valor" was overcome, as it often is, by the anticipated
honor and glory of a single combat,
and conquest of such a ferocious beast. I was
well armed, too, with my favorite rifle, a Colt's
revolver, that never disappointed me, and a non-descript
weapon, a sort of cross betwixt a claymore
and a bowie-knife; so, after capping afresh,
hanging the bridle on the horn of the saddle,
and, staking my mule, I followed the trail up a
gully, and much sooner than I expected came
within view and good shooting distance of
Bruin, who was seated erect, with his side toward
me, in front of a manzanita bush, making
a repast on his favorite berry.</p>

<p>The sharp click of the cock causing him to
turn quickly round, left little time for deliberation;
so, taking a ready good aim at the region
of the heart, I let drive, the ball (as I subsequently
found) glancing along the ribs, entering
the armpit, and shattering smartly some of the
shoulder bones. I exulted as I saw him stagger
and come to his side; the next glance,
however, revealed him, to my dismay, on all
fours, in direct pursuit, but going lame; so I
bolted for the mule, sadly encumbered with a
huge pair of Mexican spurs, the nervous noise
of the crushing brush close in my rear convincing
me he was fast gaining on me; I therefore
dropped my rifle, putting on fresh steam, and
reaching the rope, pulled up the picket-pin, and
springing into the saddle with merely a hold of
the lariat, plunged the spurs into the mule,
which, much to my affright produced a kick and
a retrograde movement; but in the exertion
having got a glimpse of my pursuer, uttering;
snort of terror, he went off at a pace I did not
think him capable of, soon widening the distance
betwixt us and the bear; but having no
means of guiding his motions, he brought me
violently in contact with the arm of a tree,
which unhorsed and stunned me exceedingly.
Scrambling to my feet as well as I could, I saw
my relentless enemy close at hand, leaving me
the only alternative of ascending a tree; but,
in my hurried and nervous efforts, I had scarcely
my feet above his reach, when he was right under,
evidently enfeebled by the loss of blood, as
the exertion made it well out copiously. After
a moment's pause, and a fierce glare upward
from his blood-shot eyes, he clasped the trunk;
but I saw his endeavors to climb were crippled
by the wounded shoulder. However, by the aid
of his jaws, he just succeeded in reaching the
first branch with his sound arm, and was working
convulsively to bring up the body, when,
with a well-directed blow from my cutlass, I
completely severed the tendons of the foot, and
he instantly fell with a dreadful souse and horrific
growl, the blood spouting up as if impelled
from a jet; he rose again somewhat tardily,
and limping round the tree with upturned eyes,
kept tearing off the bark with his tusks. However,
watching my opportunity, and leaning
downward, I sent a ball from my revolver with
such good effect immediately behind the head,
that he dropped; and my nerves being now
rather more composed, I leisurely distributed
the remaining five balls in the most vulnerable
parts of his carcase.</p>

<p>By this time I saw the muscular system totally
relaxed, so I descended with confidence,
and found him quite dead, and myself not a
little enervated with the excitement and the
effects of my wound, which bled profusely from
the temple; so much so, that I thought an artery
was ruptured. I bound up my head as
well as I could, loaded my revolver anew, and
returned for my rifle; but as evening was approaching,
and my mule gone, I had little time
to survey the dimensions of my fallen foe, and
no means of packing much of his flesh. I therefore
hastily hacked off a few steaks from his
thigh, and hewing off one of his hind feet as a
sure trophy of victory, I set out toward the trading-post,
which I reached about midnight, my
friend and my truant mule being there before
me, but no horses.</p>

<p>I exhibited the foot of my fallen foe in great
triumph, and described the conflict with due
emphasis and effect to the company, who arose
to listen; after which I made a transfer of the
flesh to the traders, on condition that there was
not to be any charge for the hotel or the use of
the mule. There was an old experienced French
trapper of the party, who, judging from the size
of the foot, set down the weight of the bear at
1500 lbs., which, he said they frequently over-run,
he himself, as well as Colonel Fr&eacute;mont's
exploring party, having killed several that came
to 2000 lbs. He advised me, should I again
be pursued by a bear, and have no other means
of escape, to ascend a small-girthed tree, which
they can not get up, for, not having any central
joint in the fore-legs, they can not climb any
with a branchless stem that does not fully fill
their embrace; and in the event of not being
able to accomplish the ascent before my pursuer
overtook me, to place my back against it, when,
if it and I did not constitute a bulk capable of
filling his hug, I might have time to rip out his
entrails before he could kill me, being in a most
favorable posture for the operation. They do
not generally use their mouth in the destruction
of their victims, but, hugging them closely, lift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
one of the hind-feet, which are armed with tremendous
claws, and tear out the bowels. The
Frenchman's advice reads rationally enough,
and is a feasible theory on the art of evading
unbearable compression; but, unfortunately, in
the haunts of that animal those slim juvenile
saplings are rarely met with, and a person
closely confronted with such a grizzly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>
is not exactly in a tone of nerve for surgical
operations.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>A VISIT TO THE NORTH CAPE.</h2>


<p>Having hired an open boat and a crew of
three hands, I left Hammerfest at nine <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
July 2, 1850, to visit the celebrated Nordkap.
The boat was one of the peculiar Nordland build&mdash;very
long, narrow, sharp, but strongly built,
with both ends shaped alike, and excellently
adapted either for rowing or sailing. We had
a strong head-wind from northeast at starting,
and rowed across the harbor to the spot
where the house of the British consul, Mr. Robertson,
a Scotchman, is situated, near to the little
battery (<i>f&aelig;stning</i>) which was erected to defend
the approach to Hammerfest, subsequently to
the atrocious seizure of the place by two English
ships during the last war. Mr. Robertson
kindly lent me a number of reindeer skins to lie
on at the bottom of the boat; and spreading
them on the rough stones we carried for ballast,
I was thus provided with an excellent bed. I
have slept for a fortnight at a time on reindeer
skins, and prefer them to any feather bed. Mr.
Robertson warned me that I should find it bitterly
cold at sea, and expressed surprise at my
light clothing; but I smiled, and assured him
that my hardy wandering life had habituated
me to bear exposure of every kind with perfect
impunity. By an ingenious contrivance of a
very long tiller, the pilot steered with one hand
and rowed with the other, and we speedily
cleared the harbor, and crept round the coast of
Qual Oe (Whale-Island), on which Hammerfest
is situated. About midnight, when the sun was
shining a considerable way above the horizon,
the view of a solitary little rock, in the ocean
ahead, bathed in a flood of crimson glory, was
most impressive. We proceeded with a tolerable
wind until six in the morning, when heavy
squalls of wind and torrents of rain began to
beat upon us, forcing us to run, about two hours
afterward, into Hav&ouml;sund; a very narrow strait
between the island of Hav&ouml;e and the mainland
of Finmark. As it was impossible to proceed
in such a tempest, we ran the boat to a landing-place
in front of the summer residence of
Herr Ulich, a great magnate in Finmark. This
is undoubtedly the most northern gentleman's
house in the world. It is a large, handsome,
wooden building, painted white, and quite equal
in appearance to the better class of villas in the
North. The family only reside there during
the three summer months; and extensive warehouses
for the trade in dried cod or stockfish,
&amp;c. are attached. My crew obtained shelter in
an outbuilding, and I unhesitatingly sought the
hospitality of the mansion. Herr Ulich himself
was absent, being at his house at Hammerfest,
but his amiable lady, and her son and two
daughters, received me with a frank cordiality
as great as though I were an old friend; and
in a few minutes I was thoroughly at home.
Here I found a highly accomplished family, surrounded
with the luxuries and refinements of
civilization, dwelling amid the wildest solitudes,
and so near the North Cape, that it can be distinctly
seen from their house in clear weather.
Madame Ulich and her daughters spoke nothing
but Norwegian; but the son, a very intelligent
young man of about nineteen, spoke English
very well. He had recently returned from a
two years' residence at Archangel, where the
merchants of Finmark send their sons to learn
the Russian language, as it is of vital importance
for their trading interests&mdash;the greater portion
of the trade of Finmark being with the White-Sea
districts, which supply them with meal and
other necessaries in exchange for stockfish, &amp;c.
Near as they were to the North Cape, it was a
singular fact that Herr Ulich and his son had
only once visited it; and the former had resided
ten years at Hav&ouml;sund&mdash;not more than twenty-five
miles distant&mdash;ere that visit took place!
They said that very few travelers visited the
Cape; and, strange to say, the majority are
French and Italians.</p>

<p>I declined to avail myself of the pressing
offer of a bed, and spent the morning in conversation
with this very interesting family. They
had a handsome drawing-room, containing a
grand colossal bust in bronze of Louis-Philippe,
King of the French. The ex-king, about fifty-five
years ago, when a wandering exile (under
the assumed name of M&uuml;ller) visited the North
Cape. He experienced hospitality from many
residents in Finmark, and he had slept in this
very room; but the house itself then stood on
Maas Island, a few miles further north. Many
years ago, the present proprietor removed the
entire structure to Hav&ouml;e; and his son assured
me the room itself was preserved almost exactly
as it was when Louis Philippe used it, though
considerable additions and improvements have
been made to other parts of the house. About
sixteen years ago, Paul Garnard, the president
of the commission shortly afterward sent by the
French government to explore Greenland and
Iceland, called on Herr Ulich, and said he was
instructed by the king to ask what present he
would prefer from his majesty as a memorial of
his visit to the North. A year afterward, the
corvette of war, <i>La Recherche</i>, on its way to
Iceland, &amp;c. put into Hav&ouml;sund, and left the
bust in question, as the express gift of the king.
It is a grand work of art, executed in the finest
style, and is intrinsically very valuable, although
of course the circumstances under which it became
Herr Ulich's property add inestimably to
its worth in his eyes. The latter gentleman is
himself a remarkable specimen of the highly-educated
Norwegian. He has traveled over all
Europe, and speaks, more or less, most civilized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
languages. On my return to Hammerfest I
enjoyed the pleasure of his society, and his eager
hospitality; and he favored me with an introduction
for the Norwegian states minister at
Stockholm. I merely mention these things to
show the warm-hearted kindness which even an
unintroduced, unknown traveler may experience
in the far North. Herr Ulich has resided twenty-five
years at Hav&ouml;sund; and he says he thinks
that not more than six English travelers have
visited the North Cape within twenty years&mdash;that
is to say, by way of Hammerfest; but
parties of English gentlemen occasionally proceed
direct in their yachts.</p>

<p>Fain would my new friends have delayed my
departure; but, wind and tide serving, I resumed
my voyage at noon, promising to call on
my return. In sailing through the sound, I
noticed a neat little wooden church, the most
northern in Finmark. A minister preaches in
it to the Fins and Laps at intervals, which
depend much on the state of the weather; but
I believe once a month in summer. The congregation
come from a circle of immense extent.
If I do not err, Mr. Robert Chambers mentions
in his tour having met with the clergyman of
this wild parish.</p>

<p>Passing Maas Oe, we sailed across an open
arm of the sea, and reached the coast of Mager
Oe, the island on which the North Cape is
situated. Mager Oe is perhaps twenty miles
long by a dozen broad, and is separated from
the extreme northern mainland of Finmark by
Mager&ouml;sund. Although a favorable wind blew,
my crew persisted in running into a harbor here,
where there is a very extensive fish-curing
establishment, called Gjesvohr, belonging to
Messrs Agaard of Hammerfest. There are
several houses, sheds, &amp;c. and immense tiers of
the split stockfish drying across horizontal poles.
At this time about two hundred people were
employed, and one or two of the singular three-masted
White-Sea ships were in the harbor,
with many Finmark fishing-boats. The water
was literally black with droves of young cod,
which might have been killed by dozens as they
basked near the surface. My men loitered hour
after hour; but as I was most anxious to visit
the North Cape when the midnight sun illumined
it, I induced them to proceed.</p>

<p>On resuming our voyage, we coasted along
the shore, which was one mass of savage, precipitous
rock, until the black massive Cape
loomed very distinctly in the horizon. I landed
at a bluff headland called Tunoes, and collected
a few flowers growing in crevices in the rock.
A little beyond that, in Sandbugt, a fragment
of wreck was discernible, and I ordered the boat
to be pulled toward it. It proved to be a
portion of the keel of a large ship, about fifty
feet long, and much worn. It had evidently
been hauled on the reefs by some fishermen, and
the fortunate salvors had placed their rude
marks upon it. I mused over this fragment of
wreck, which was mutely eloquent with melancholy
suggestiveness. How many prayers had
gone forth with the unknown ship! how many
fathers, brothers, sisters, lovers, and unconscious
widows and orphans, might at that moment be
hoping against hope for her return! To what
port did she belong? In what remote ocean
had she met her doom? Perchance this keel
had been borne by wind and tide from some
region of thick-ribbed ice, and was the only
relic to tell of the dark fate of a gallant bark
and brave crew! Alas, what a thrilling history
might that weed-tangled piece of wood be
linked with, and what food did it supply for the
wanderer's imagination!</p>

<p>Resuming the voyage, we came to a long
promontory of solid rock, stretching far into the
sea, where it tapers down to the level of the
water. It is called Kniuskj&oelig;rodden; and I
particularly draw attention to it for the following
reason: at Hammerfest the consul favored
me with an inspection of the charts recently
published by the Norwegian government, from
express surveys by scientific officers of their
navy. The instant I cast my eye over the one
containing Mager Oe, I perceived that Kniuskj&oelig;rodden
was set down <i>further north than the
North Cape itself</i>! The consul said that such
was the actual fact, though he will not consent
to its disputing the legitimacy of the ancient
fame which the Cape worthily enjoys; since it
is merely a low, narrow projection, of altogether
insignificant character. I walked to its extremity,
and narrowly escaped being washed by the
roaring breakers into the deep transparent sea.</p>

<p>Rounding Kniuskj&oelig;rodden, the North Cape
burst in all its sunlit grandeur on my delighted
view. It was now a dead calm, and my vikings
pulled very slowly across the grand bay of
Kniusv&oelig;rig, to afford me an opportunity of
sketching the object, which is one enormous
mass of solid rock, upward of a thousand feet
in elevation. I can compare it to nothing more
fitly than the keep of a castle of a tremendous
size; for it very gently tapers upward from the
base, and presents a surface marvelously resembling
time-worn masonry. The front approaches
the perpendicular, and so does much
of the western side also. The color of this
mighty rock is a dark, shining, speckled gray,
relieved by dazzling masses of snow lying in
the gigantic fissures, which seem to have been
riven by some dread convulsion. The impression
I felt as the boat glided beneath its shadow
was one of thrilling awe; for its magnificent
stern proportions&mdash;its colossal magnitude&mdash;its
position as the lonely, unchanging sentinel of
nature, which for countless ages has stood forth
as the termination of the European continent,
frowning defiance to the maddening fury of the
mystic Arctic Queen&mdash;all combine to invest it
with associations and attributes of overpowering
majesty. My ideas of its sublimity were
more than realized; and as I landed on its
base, in the blaze of the midnight sun, I felt
an emotion of proud joy, that my long-feasted
hope of gazing upon it at such an hour, and under
such circumstances, was literally fulfilled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The only place where a landing can be effected
is on the western side, about a mile and a half
from the head of the Cape; and it is usual for
those who ascend it to go many miles round
from this starting-place to gain the summit,
because a direct upward ascent is considered
impracticable. But having much confidence in
my climbing capabilities, I resolved to adventure
the latter feat; and although burdened
with my sea-cloak and other things, I instantly
commenced the task, leaving the crew to slumber
in the boat until my return. I found the
whole of the western side, opposite the landing-place,
clothed with the most luxuriant vegetation
to the height of about a hundred yards.
There were myriads of flowers, including exquisite
white violets with hairy stems; purple,
red, and white star-flowers; the beautiful large
yellow cup-flower, growing on stems two feet
high, and called by the Norwegians <i>knap-sul-len-&ouml;ie-blomster</i>
(literally, button-sun-eye-flower);
and many other varieties of species unknown to
me. There were also several kinds of dwarf
shrubs, including the juniper, then in green
berry. Butterflies and insects flitted gayly
from flower to flower. After resting on a ledge
of rock to take breath, and look down on the
glassy waters and the boat at my feet&mdash;now
dwindled to a speck&mdash;I resumed my clambering;
but to my extreme mortification, when I
had ascended two-thirds of the way, at no
small risk to my bones, I was mastered by
overhanging masses of rock, all trickling with
slimy moisture from the congealed snow above.
Here I had a narrow escape from being killed
by a fragment of loose rock giving way beneath
me, and drawing down other pieces after
it; but I clung tenaciously to a firm part, and
the heavy stones bounded harmlessly over my
head. I descended with difficulty; and after
carefully surveying the face of the rocks, tried
at a more favorable place, and even then I was
above an hour in gaining the summit. I understand
that I am the first adventurer who
has scaled the Cape at that place; and I certainly
was thankful when I could throw my
weary frame down, and eat some frugal fare,
slaking my thirst with a handful of snow from
the solid patch by my side. Though I had
been more than forty-eight hours without rest,
bodily fatigue was little felt. I could behold
from my airy elevation many miles of the surface
of the island. The higher peaks and the
sheltered hollows were clothed with snow, glittering
in the midnight sun, and several dark
lakes nestled amid the frowning rocks.</p>

<p>Resuming my progress, I passed over the surface
of the Cape. It is covered with slaty <i>d&eacute;bris</i>,
and, what struck me as very remarkable,
quantities of a substance resembling coarse white
marble, totally different from the Cape itself.
The only vegetation on the summit is a species
of moss, which bears most beautiful flowers,
generally of a purple hue, blooming in hundreds
and thousands together. These dumb witnesses
of nature's benevolent handiwork filled
my soul with pleasing, grateful thoughts, and
uplifted it to the Divine Being who maketh
flowers to bloom and waters to gush in the
most desolate regions of the earth. In the bed
of a ravine, crossed in my way toward the
end of the Cape, I found a rapid stream of the
purest water, which proved deliciously refreshing.
I wandered along; and, after skirting
much of the western precipice, drew nigh the
bourne of my pilgrimage. The Cape terminates
in a shape approaching a semicircle, but the
most northern part swells out in a clear appreciable
point. About a hundred yards from the
latter I came upon a circle of stones, piled
nearly breast high, inclosing a space some dozen
feet in diameter. This had evidently been
erected by a party of visitors as a shelter from
the winds. Not far distant, a block of black
rock rises above the level, which is otherwise
smooth as a bowling-green, and covered with
minute fragments of rock. Within two or three
yards of the extreme point is a small pole, sustained
in the centre of a pile of stones. I found
several initials and dates cut on this very
perishable register, and added my own. I believe
it was set up by the government expedition
three or four years ago as a signal-post for
their trigonometrical survey.</p>

<p>I can not adequately describe the tide of
emotion which filled my soul as I walked up
to the dizzy verge. I only know that, after
standing a moment with folded arms, beating
heart, and tear-dimmed eye, I knelt, and with
lowly-bowed head, returned thanks to God for
permitting me to thus realize one darling dream
of my boyhood!</p>

<p>Despite the wind, which here blew violently,
I sat down by the side of the pole, and wrapping
my cloak around me, long contemplated
the grand spectacle of nature in one of her
sublimest aspects. I was truly alone. Not a
living being was in sight: far beneath was the
boundless expanse of ocean, with a sail or two
on its bosom, at an immense distance; above
was the canopy of heaven, flecked with snowy
cloudlets; the sun was gleaming through a
broad belt of blood-red horizon; the only sounds
were the whistling of the wind, and the occasional
plaintive scream of hovering sea-fowl.
My pervading feeling was a calm though deep
sense of intellectual enjoyment and triumph&mdash;very
natural to an enthusiastic young wanderer
upon achieving one of the long-cherished enterprises
of his life.</p>

<p>With reluctant and wildly-devious steps, I
bade what is probably an eternal adieu to the
wondrous Cape, and effected a comparatively
easy descent to the place whence I had started.
My men had dropped grapnel a considerable
distance from the rock; and being unwilling to
disturb their slumber, I spent some further time
in exploring the western base. There is a very
curious cavernous range of rock washed out by
the terrific beating of wintry storms, so as to
form a species of arcade. The sides are of immense
thickness, but the sea has worn them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
open at the top. The water here, as along the
whole coast of Norway and Finmark, is marvelously
transparent. Weeds and fish may be seen
at a prodigious depth clearly as in a mirror.</p>

<p>On the return voyage, we ran into a creek
near Sandbugt, and the crew went ashore to a
Lap <i>gamme</i> (hut) to sleep; but as I had no desire
to furnish a dainty fresh meal to the vermin
with which every gamme swarms, I slept
soundly on my reindeer skins in the boat, although
it was now rainy and intensely cold.
After the lapse of a few hours I joined them at
the gamme, and bought a fine <i>p&oelig;sk</i> or tunic of
reindeer skin from an old Lap; and learning
that his herd of reins was in the vicinity, I had
a long ramble in search of them, but without
avail; for they had wandered far away, influenced
by that remarkable instinct which impels
reindeer to invariably run <i>against</i> the
wind. I gathered some fine specimens of sponge
in marshy hollows. In the course of our subsequent
voyage, I made another pause of a few
hours at Giesvohr, where I examined the works
for curing the fish and extracting the oil, but
declined taking any repose. Next morning,
being favored with a powerful wind, our little
craft fairly leaped over the waves; and I noted
her dextrous management with the eye of an
amateur receiving a valuable lesson. The old
pilot kept the sheet of the lug-sail constantly
ready to slip, and another hand stood by the
greased halyard to let all go by the run; for
there are frequent eddies and squalls of wind
along this very dangerous coast, which would upset
a boat in an instant, were not great tact and
unremitting vigilance exercised. The sea ran
exceedingly high, and we shipped water from
stem to stern every time we settled in its
trough, in such a way that the baling never
ceased. Safely, however, did we run into
Hav&ouml;sund once more at about eight o'clock.</p>

<p>Young Ulich welcomed my unexpectedly early
return at the landing-place, and I was delighted
to again become the eagerly-welcomed guest of
his house. Happily, and only too quickly, did
the time speed. I chatted in my sadly-broken
Norwegian&mdash;the first to laugh at my own
comical blunders; and the eldest young lady
sweetly sang to me several of the most ancient
and popular of her native ballads, accompanying
them on her guitar&mdash;the fashionable instrument
of music in the North, where many things
which have fallen into desuetude with us universally
flourish. As she could understand no
other language, I in return did my best to chant
the celebrated national Danish song, <i>Den tappre
Landsoldat</i>, the fame of which has penetrated
to the far North. So popular is this song in
Denmark, that its author and composer have
both recently received an order of knighthood
for it. In the library were translations of Marryat,
and other English novelists; and they
showed me a copy of&mdash;Cruikshank's <i>Bottle</i>! I
thought that if that gifted artist could have
thus beheld how his fame and a genuine copy
of his greatest work has penetrated, and is
highly appreciated in the vicinity of the North
Cape, he would have experienced a glow of enviable,
and not undeserved satisfaction. The
only teetotaller, by the way, whom I ever met
with in Scandinavia, was one of the crew of
the boat with me. He invariably declined the
<i>br&aelig;ndiviin</i>, as I passed it round from time to
time, and assured me he drank only water and
milk.</p>

<p>The young ladies had about a score of pretty
tame pigeons; and to my extreme regret a couple
were killed, to give me an additional treat
at a dinner served in a style which I should
rather have expected to meet with in an English
hotel than at a solitary house on an arctic
island. They afterward conducted me to their&mdash;garden!
Yes, a veritable garden, the fame
of which has extended far and wide in Finmark;
for there is nothing to compare to it for
at least four hundred miles southward. It is
of considerable size, inclosed by high wooden
walls, painted black to attract the sun's rays,
which are very fervid in the latter end of summer.
Potatoes, peas, and other table vegetables,
were in a thriving state, but only come to
maturity in favorable seasons. I had some
radishes at dinner, and excellent they were.
Glazed frames protected cucumber and other
plants, and many very beautiful and delicate
flowers bloomed in the open air. The young
ladies gathered some of the finest specimens of
these, including large blue forget-me-nots, and
placed them within the leaves of my Bible.
Highly do I treasure them, for they will ever
vividly recall a host of pleasant and romantic
associations.</p>

<p>Most pressing were they all to induce me to
stay some days with them, and gladly indeed
would I have complied had circumstances permitted;
but I felt compelled to hasten back to
Hammerfest. In the afternoon, therefore, I bade
adieu to a family which had shown me a degree
of engaging kindness greater than any I
had experienced since I left my warmly-attached
Danish friends.</p>

<p>The remainder of our return voyage was wet
and tempestuous. We sailed and rowed all
night, and reached Hammerfest at eight <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
on July 5, much to the astonishment of the good
folks there, who had not anticipated seeing us
again in less than a week or ten days. The
consul and many others assured me that my
voyage had been performed with unprecedented
speed, the whole time occupied being not quite
three and a half days.</p>

<h2>A CONVERSATION IN A KENTUCKY STAGE COACH.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h2>


<p>I can not refrain from giving a conversation
which I heard as we came by the coach to
Louisville. One of the speakers was a very
agreeable and apparently well-informed gentleman,
who seemed to have seen a great deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the world. When he first entered the "stage,"
it would seem it was with the benignant intention
of giving a sort of <i>converzatione</i> in the
coach, in which, after a few preliminary interrogatories
to the various passengers (as if to take
the size and measure of their capacities), he
sustained all the active part, not calling upon
them for the slightest exercise of their conversational
powers. He varied the entertainment
occasionally, by soliloquizing and monopolyguizing;
and ever and anon it appeared as if he
addressed the human race generally, or was
speaking for posterity in a very elevated tone
indeed, and seemingly oblivious of that fraction
of the contemporaneous generation who were
then largely benefiting by his really most animated
and amusing discourse&mdash;for he was
thoroughly original and very shrewd and entertaining.</p>

<p>Where had he not been? What had he not
seen? what not met, tried, suffered, sought,
found, dared, done, won, lost, said? The last
we could give the most implicit credence to, no
matter how large the demand. Now he told
us, or the ceiling of the coach, how he had been
eighteen months in the prairies (which keep very
open house for all visitors), shooting herds of
buffaloes, and with his cloak for his only castle,
and all his household furniture, and how he had
been all this time without bed or bread: and he
described the longing for the last, much in the
way Mr. Ruxton does in his account of prairie
excursions; and now&mdash;but I will not attempt
to follow him in all his wondrous adventures.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, Robinson Crusoe, placed in
juxtaposition with him, was a mere fire-side
stay-at-home sort of personage, one who had
never left his own comfortable arm-chair, in
comparison. In short, the adventures were
marvelous and manifold, and all told in the
same agreeable, lively, Scheherezade-like sort
of a manner&mdash;so agreeable, indeed, that I am
sure had Judge Lynch himself had any little
account to settle with him, he would have postponed&mdash;<i>&agrave;
la</i> Sultan of the Indies&mdash;any trifling
beheading or strangling, or unpleasant little
operation of the sort, to hear the end of the
tale.</p>

<p>After these narratives and amusing lectures
had been poured forth continuously for a length
of time, it chanced that a quiet countryman-like
person got into the coach, bundle and stick in
hand. After a few questions to this rustic wayfarer,
our eloquent orator left off his historic and
other tales, and devoted himself to drawing out,
and "squeezing the orange of the brains" of
this apparently simple-minded and unlettered
man. The discourse that ensued was a singular
one&mdash;to take place, too, in the United States
between Americans.</p>

<p>The new-comer was a Kentuckian by birth,
who had not very long ago gone to settle in Indiana.
He called himself a mechanic&mdash;these
facts came out in answer to the queries put to
him by our unwearied talker&mdash;but he had, as I
have said, much more the appearance of a respectable
country farming man&mdash;and, indeed,
I believe, mechanic means here, in a general
sense, a laborer. He seemed a fine, honest-hearted,
straight-forward, noble-spirited son of
the plow; and his lofty, earnest, generous sentiments
were spoken in somewhat unpolished
but energetic and good language; and what
particularly struck me was a really beautiful
and almost child-like simplicity of mind and
manner, that was combined with the most uncompromising
firmness and unflinching adherence
in argument, to what he conceived to be right.</p>

<p>His features were decidedly plain, but the
countenance was very fine, chiefly characterized
by great ingenuousness, commingled with gentleness
and benevolence; and yet bearing evident
traces of strength, determination, and energetic
resolution. It was rather a complicated countenance,
so to say, notwithstanding its great openness
and expression of downright truth and goodness.</p>

<p>After opening the conversation with him, as
you would an oyster, by the introduction of a
pretty keen knife of inquisitorial questions, the
chief speaker began to hold forth, capriciously
enough, on the essentials and distinguishing
attributes of a gentleman. He declared, emphatically,
that one qualification alone was
necessary, and that money only made a gentleman,
according to the world, and, above all, in
the United States (quite a mistake is this, I
fully believe). "Let a man," said he, "be
dressed here in every thing of the best, with
splendid rings on his fingers, and plenty of money
to spend at the ends of them, and he may go
where he will, and be received as a gentleman;
ay, though he may be a gambler, a rogue, or a
swindler, and you, now, <i>you</i> may be a good
honest mechanic; but <i>he</i> will at once get into
the best society in these parts, which you
would never dream even of attempting to accomplish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he would not be a gentleman," broke
in the Kentuckian, indignantly. "No, sir; nor
will I ever allow that money only makes the
gentleman: it is the principle, sir, and the inner
feeling, and the mind&mdash;and no fine clothes
can ever make it; and no rough ones unmake
it, that's a fact. And, sir, there's many a better
gentleman following the plow in these parts
than there is among the richer classes: I mean
those poor men who're contented with their lot,
and work hard and try no mean shifts and
methods to get on an' up in the world; for
there's little some 'ill stick at to get at money;
and such means a true gentleman (what <i>I</i> call
a gentleman) will avoid like poison, and scorn
utterly."</p>

<p>"Now, that's all very well for you to talk so
here just now; but you know yourself, I don't
doubt, that <i>your own</i> object, as well as all the
world's around you, is to make money. It is
with that object that you work hard and save
up: you do not work only to live, or make yourself
more comfortable, but to get money: and
money is the be-all and end-all of all and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
body; and that only commands consideration
and respect."</p>

<p>"That <i>only</i>, sir, would never command <i>mine</i>,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, how you talk now! if you meet a fine
dressed-out gentleman in one of these stages, you
look on him as one directly&mdash;you don't ask him
did he <i>make</i> or <i>take</i> his money&mdash;what's that to
you?&mdash;there he is, and it is not for you to busy
or bother yourself to find out all the private
particulars of his history; and if you find him,
as I say, well dressed in superfine, and he acts
the gentleman to you, he may be the greatest
rogue in existence, but he will be treated by
you like a gentleman&mdash;yes, even by you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that maybe while I know nothing
of him&mdash;while, as you say, he acts the gentleman
to me; but let me <i>once find out</i> what he is,
and I would never show him respect more&mdash;no!
though he had all the gold of California."</p>

<p>"Ah, California! just look at <i>that</i> now&mdash;look
at people by scores and thousands, leaving their
families, and friends, and homes&mdash;and what for
but for gold? people with a comfortable competence
already; but it's fine talking. Why,
what are <i>you</i> taking this very journey for?&mdash;why,
I can answer for you&mdash;for gold, I doubt
not; and every other action of your life is for
that object: confess the real truth now."</p>

<p>"I will, sir&mdash;I am come here from Indiana,
for though I'm a Kentucky man, I live in the
Hoosier State. I'm come here to see a dear
brother; and instead of <i>gaining</i> money I'm
<i>spending</i> it in these stages to get to see him
and 'old Kentuck' agin. So you see, Sir, I love
my brother&mdash;I do, more than money, poor man
as I am; ay, and that I do, too."</p>

<p>"Well, I dare say you do; but come now,
just tell me&mdash;haven't you a little bit of a
<i>speculation</i>, now, here, that you're come after,
as well as your brother&mdash;some trifle of a speculation
afoot? You know you have now. You
<i>must</i> have. Some horse, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was quite delightful to see and hear the indignant
burst of eager denial which this elicited
from the ingenuous Kentuckian.</p>

<p>"No, sir! <i>no</i>, I have <i>not</i>&mdash;none whatever,
indeed I have not:" his voice quivered with
emotion; the earnest expression of his countenance
was more than eloquent. If his interrogator
had accused him of a serious crime he
could hardly more anxiously and more earnestly
have disclaimed it. To him, I thought the bare
suspicion seemed like a coarse desecration of his
real motives, a kind of undervaluing even of his
"dear brother," to suppose he must have had a
"little speculation on hand" to make it worth
his while to go to see <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>He went on in an agitated, eager tone:</p>

<p>"And look ye here; I am <i>leaving off</i> my
work and money-making for some days on purpose&mdash;only
for that, and spending money at it,
too!"</p>

<p>His somewhat case-hardened antagonist looked
the least in the world discomfited; for that angry
denial was a magnificent burst, and uttered in a
tone that actually seemed to give an additional
jolt to the rough coach; and I might say it
had really a splendid theatrical effect, but that
I should hesitate to use that expression with
reference to one of the most beautiful natural
exhibitions of deep feeling and generous sentiment
I ever witnessed.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to?" at last inquired
the other, apparently about to commence a little
cross-examination.</p>

<p>"About twenty miles beyond Munsfordville,"
replied Kentucky, in his simple direct manner,
"to"&mdash;I forget the name.</p>

<p>"Why, you're come by the wrong stage,
then," exclaimed the other, "you should have
waited till to-morrow, and then taken the stage
to &mdash;&mdash;, and then you would have gone
direct."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir; it's true enough, sir; but
you see&mdash;in short, I couldn't <i>wait</i>&mdash;no, that I
couldn't. I was so anxious, and I felt so like
seeing my brother; and I was in such a mortal
hurry to get to him."</p>

<p>"Hurry, man! why how will you see him
any sooner by this? Why, you might as well
have walked up and down Main-street till to-morrow;
it would have advanced you just as
much on your journey."</p>

<p>"You're right, sir, I know that; but I really
<i>couldn't</i> wait: I wanted to feel I was going
ahead, and getting <i>nearer</i> my brother at any
rate; I got so impatient-like. No, sir; I
couldn't have staid till the morning any how
you could fix it."</p>

<p>"You'll have to walk for your folly, for you'll
get no conveyance this way, I tell you."</p>

<p>"I'll have to walk the twenty miles to-night,
I suppose," said Kentucky, with the most imperturbable
smiling composure; "but never mind
that! I shall be getting near my brother, then.
Ha," he said, after a pause, "you see I <i>do</i> love
my brother, sir, and I don't regard trouble for
him. I'll have to walk the twenty miles to-night
with my bundle, I dare say, and spending
money at that, too, perhaps, for a bit of food;
but I couldn't have <i>waited</i>&mdash;no! not another
hour at Louisville&mdash;I felt so like getting <i>nearer</i>
to my brother."</p>

<p>At the end of the argument about money-making
being the all in all, one or two of us
signified briefly that we thought Kentucky was
right. You never saw any body so surprised.
He had evidently entertained a deep conviction
that all in the stage-coach were opposed to his
opinions, and that he stood alone in his view
on the matter. He replied he was glad any
body thought as he did, and reiterated with
strong emphasis to his opponent:</p>

<p>"I'm sure, sir, I'm right; it is the principle,
and the manners, and the mind, and <i>not</i> money
that makes a gentleman. No, no; money can
never make half a one."</p>

<p>I shall feel a respect for "old Kentucky" forever
after for his sake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h2>ANECDOTES OF JOHN PHILPOT CURRAN.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></h2>


<h3>CURRAN'S START IN LIFE.</h3>

<p>After toiling for a very inadequate recompense
at the sessions of Cork, and wearing,
as he said himself, his teeth almost to their
stumps, Curran proceeded to the metropolis,
taking for his wife and young children a miserable
lodging upon <i>Hay Hill</i>. Term after term,
without either profit or professional reputation,
he paced the hall of the Four Courts. Among
those who had the discrimination to appreciate,
and the heart to feel for him, luckily for Curran,
was Mr. Arthur Wolfe, afterward the unfortunate
but respected Lord Kilwarden. The first
fee of any consequence which he received was
through his recommendation; and his recital of
the incident can not be without its interest to
the young professional aspirant whom a temporary
neglect may have sunk into dejection.
"I then lived," said he, "upon Hay Hill; my
wife and children were the chief furniture of my
apartments; and as to my rent, it stood pretty
much the same chance of liquidation with the
national debt. Mrs. Curran, however, was a
barrister's lady, and what she wanted in wealth
she was well determined should be supplied by
dignity. The landlady, on the other hand, had
no idea of any gradation except that of pounds,
shillings, and pence. I walked out one morning
to avoid the perpetual altercations on the subject,
with my mind, you may imagine, in no
very enviable temperament. I fell into the
gloom to which, from my infancy, I had been
occasionally subject. I had a family for whom
I had no dinner, and a landlady for whom I
had no rent. I had gone abroad in despondence&mdash;I
returned home almost in desperation. When
I opened the door of my study, where <i>Lavater</i>
alone could have found a library, the first object
which presented itself was an immense
folio of a brief, twenty golden guineas wrapped
up beside it, and the name of <i>Old Bob Lyons</i>
marked upon the back of it. I paid my landlady&mdash;bought
a good dinner&mdash;gave Bob Lyons
a share of it&mdash;and that dinner was the date of
my prosperity." Such was his own exact account
of his professional advancement.</p>


<h3>SINGULAR ATTEMPT UPON CURRAN'S LIFE.</h3>

<p>In one of Curran's professional excursions, a
very singular circumstance had almost rendered
this the termination of his biography. He was
on a temporary visit to the neighboring town
of Sligo, and was one morning standing at his
bedroom window, which overlooked the street,
occupied, as he told me, in arranging his portmanteau,
when he was stunned by the report
of a blunderbuss in the very chamber with him,
and the panes above his head were all shivered
into atoms. He looked suddenly around in the
greatest consternation. The room was full of
smoke, the blunderbuss on the floor just discharged,
the door closed, and no human being
but himself discoverable in the apartment! If
this had happened in his rural retreat, it could
readily have been reconciled through the medium
of some offended spirit of the village mythology;
but, as it was, he was in a populous town, in
a civilized family, among Christian doctrines,
where the fairies had no power, and their gambols
no currency; and, to crown all, a poor
cobbler, into whose stall on the opposite side
of the street the slugs had penetrated, hinted in
no very equivocal terms that the whole affair
was a conspiracy against his life. It was by no
means a pleasant addition to the chances of assassination
to be loudly declaimed against by a
crazed mechanic as an assassin himself. Day
after day passed away without any solution of
the mystery; when one evening, as the servants
of the family were conversing round the fire on
so miraculous an escape, a little urchin, not ten
years old, was heard so to wonder how <i>such an
aim</i> was missed, that a universal suspicion was
immediately excited. He was alternately flogged
and coaxed into a confession, which disclosed
as much precocious and malignant premeditation
as perhaps ever marked the annals
of juvenile depravity. This little miscreant had
received a box on the ear from Mr. Curran for
some alleged misconduct a few days before; the
Moor's blow did not sink into a mind more
furious for revenge, or more predisposed by
nature for such deadly impressions. He was in
the bedroom by mere chance when Mr. Curran
entered; he immediately hid himself in the curtains
till he observed him too busy with his portmanteau
for observation; he then leveled at him
the old blunderbuss, which lay charged in the
corner, the stiffness of whose trigger, too strong
for his infant fingers, alone prevented the aim
which he confessed he had taken, and which
had so nearly terminated the occupations of the
cobbler. The door was ajar, and, mid the
smoke and terror, he easily slipped out without
discovery. I had the story verbatim a few
months ago from Mr. Curran's lips, whose impressions
on the subject it was no wonder that
forty years had not obliterated.</p>


<h3>CURRAN AS A CROSS-EXAMINER.</h3>

<p>At cross-examination, the most difficult and
by far the most hazardous part of a barrister's
profession, Curran was quite inimitable. There
was no plan which he did not detect, no web
which he did not disentangle; and the unfortunate
wretch, who commenced with all the
confidence of preconcerted perjury, never failed
to retreat before him in all the confusion of
exposure. Indeed, it was almost impossible for
the guilty to offer a successful resistance. He
argued, he cajoled, he ridiculed, he mimicked,
he played off the various artillery of his talent
upon the witness; he would affect earnestness
upon trifles, and levity upon subjects of the
most serious import, until at length he succeeded
in creating a security that was fatal, or a sullenness
that produced all the consequences of prevarication.
No matter how unfair the topic, he
never failed to avail himself of it; acting upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the principle that, in law as well as in war,
every stratagem was admissible. If he was
hard pressed, there was no peculiarity of person,
no singularity of name, no eccentricity of profession
at which he would not grasp, trying to
confound the self-possession of the witness by
the, no matter how excited, ridicule of the
audience. To a witness of the name of <i>Halfpenny</i>
he once began: "Halfpenny, I see you're
a <i>rap</i>, and for that reason you shall be nailed to
the counter." "Halfpenny is <i>sterling</i>," exclaimed
the opposite counsel. "No, no," said
he, "he's exactly like his own conscience&mdash;only
<i>copper washed</i>." This phrase alluded to an
expression previously used on the trial.</p>

<p>To <i>Lundy Foot</i>, the celebrated tobacconist,
once hesitating on the table: "Lundy, Lundy&mdash;that's
a poser&mdash;<i>a devil of a pinch</i>." This
gentleman applied to Curran for a motto when
he first established his carriage. "Give me
one, my dear Curran," said he, "of a serious
cast, because I am afraid the people will laugh
at a tobacconist setting up a carriage, and, <i>for
the scholarship's sake</i>, let it be in Latin." "I
have just hit on it," said Curran; "it is only
two words, and it will at once explain your
profession, your elevation, and your contempt
for their ridicule, and it has the advantage of
being in two languages, Latin or English, just
as the reader chooses. Put up '<i>Quid rides</i>'
upon your carriage."</p>

<p>Inquiring his master's age from a horse-jockey's
servant, he found it almost impossible
to extract an answer. "Come, come, friend,
has he not lost his teeth?" "Do you think,"
retorted the fellow, "that I know his age, as he
does his horse's, by <i>the mark of mouth</i>?" The
laugh was against Curran, but he instantly
recovered: "You were very right not to try,
friend, for you know your master's a <i>great bite</i>."</p>

<p>Having one day a violent argument with a
country schoolmaster on some classical subject,
the pedagogue, who had the worst of it, said,
in a towering passion, that he would lose no
more time, and must go back to his scholars.
"Do, my dear doctor," said Curran, "but <i>don't
indorse my sins upon their backs</i>."</p>

<p>Curran was told that a very stingy and
slovenly barrister had started for the Continent
with a shirt and a guinea: "He'll not change
either till he comes back," said he.</p>

<p>It was well known that Curran entertained
a dislike and a contempt for Downes. "Bushe,"
said he, "came up to me one day with a very
knowing look, and said, 'Do you know, Curran,
I have just left the pleasantest fellow I ever
met?' 'Indeed! who is he?' 'The chief
justice,' was the answer. My reply was compendious
and witty. I looked into his eye, and
said '<i>hum</i>.' It required all his oil to keep his
countenance smooth."</p>

<p>A very stupid foreman once asked a judge
how they were to ignore a bill. "Why, sir,"
said Curran, "when you mean to find a <i>true</i>
one, just write <i>Ignoramus</i> for self and fellows
on the back of it."</p>

<p>A gentleman just called to the bar took up a
pauper case. It was remarked upon. "The
man's right," said Curran; "a barber begins
on a beggar, that when he arrives at the dignity
he may know how to shave a duchess."</p>

<p>He was just rising to cross-examine a witness
before a judge who could not comprehend any
jest that was not written in <i>black letter</i>. Before
he said a single word, the witness began to
laugh. "What are you laughing at, friend&mdash;what
are you laughing at? Let me tell you
that a laugh without a joke is like&mdash;is like&mdash;" "Like
what, Mr. Curran?" asked the judge,
imagining he was nonplused. "Just exactly,
my lord, like a <i>contingent remainder</i> without
any particular <i>estate</i> to support it." I am
afraid that none but my legal readers will understand
the admirable felicity of the similitude,
but it was quite to his lordship's fancy, and
rivaled with him all "the wit that Rabelais
ever scattered."</p>

<p>Examining a country squire who disputed
a collier's bill: "Did he not give you the
<i>coals</i>, friend?" "He did, sir, but&mdash;" "But
what? On your oath, wasn't your payments
<i>slack</i>?"</p>

<p>It was thus that, in some way or other, he
contrived to throw the witnesses off their centre,
and he took care they seldom should recover it.
"My lard, my lard!" vociferated a peasant
witness, writhing under this mental excruciation,
"I can't answer yon little gentleman,
<i>he's putting me in such a doldrum</i>." "A doldrum!
Mr. Curran, what does he mean by a
doldrum!" exclaimed Lord Avonmore. "Oh!
my lord, it's a very common complaint with
persons of this description: it's merely a <i>confusion
of the head arising from the corruption
of the heart</i>."</p>

<p>To the bench he was at times quite as unceremonious;
and if he thought himself reflected
on or interfered with, had instant recourse either
to ridicule or invective. There is a celebrated
reply in circulation of Mr. Dunning to a remark
of Lord Mansfield, who curtly exclaimed at one
of his legal positions, "O! if that be law, Mr.
Dunning, I may <i>burn</i> my law-books!" "Better
<i>read</i> them, my lord," was the sarcastic and
appropriate rejoinder. In a different spirit, but
with similar effect, was Mr. Curran's retort
upon an Irish judge, quite as remarkable for
his good-humor and raillery as for his legal
researches. He was addressing a jury on one
of the state trials in 1803, with his usual animation.
The judge, whose political bias, if any
judge can have one, was certainly supposed not
to be favorable to the prisoner, <i>shook his head</i>
in doubt or denial of one of the advocate's arguments.
"I see, gentlemen," said Mr. Curran,
"I see the motion of his lordship's head; common
observers might imagine that implied a
difference of opinion, but they would be mistaken:
it is merely accidental. Believe me,
gentlemen, if you remain here many days, you
will, yourselves perceive that, when his lordship
<i>shakes his head</i>, there's <i>nothing in it</i>!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>


<h3>PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND HABITS OF GRATTAN.</h3>

<p>Grattan was short in stature, and unprepossessing
in appearance. His arms were disproportionably
long. His walk was a stride.
With a person swaying like a pendulum, and
an abstracted air, he seemed always in thought,
and each thought provoked an attendant gesticulation.
Such was the outward and visible
form of one whom the passenger would stop to
stare at as a droll, and the philosopher to contemplate
as a study. How strange it seems
that a mind so replete with grace and symmetry,
and power and splendor, should have been
allotted such a dwelling for its residence. Yet
so it was; and so also was it one of his highest
attributes, that his genius, by its "excessive
light," blinded the hearer to his physical imperfections.
It was the victory of mind over matter.
The man was forgotten in the orator.
Mr. Grattan, whose father represented the city
of Dublin in Parliament, and was also its
recorder, was born in the year 1746. He
entered the Middle Temple in 1767 and was
called to the Irish bar in 1772. In the University
of Dublin he was eminently distinguished,
sharing its honors, in <i>then</i> amicable contention,
with Fitzgibbon&mdash;not merely the antagonist,
but the enemy, and the bitter one of an after
day. We have a record, more authentic than
usual, of his pursuits while at the Temple.
The study of the law occupied but little of his
attention. He never relished it, and soon
abandoned the profession altogether. Of the
theatre he was very fond&mdash;little wonder in the
zenith of Garrick&mdash;and it was a taste he indulged
in to the last. I well remember, somewhere
about the year 1813, being in Crow-street
when he entered with Catalani leaning
on his arm. The house was crowded, and he
was hailed with acclamations. In vain he
modestly consigned them to the lovely siren
his companion. His name rang wildly through
the theatre. I think I still hear the shouts
when his person was recognized, and still behold
his venerable figure bowing its awkward
gratitude. No one knew better the true value
of that bubble tribute. Another of his amusements,
if indeed it was not something more, when
he was at the Temple, seems to have been a frequent
attendance in both houses of Parliament.
He sketched the debates and the speakers by
whom he was most attracted.</p>


<h3>O'CONNELL'S DUEL.</h3>

<p>Living, as he did, in constant turmoil, and
careless, as he was, to whom he gave offense,
O'Connell of course had a multitude of enemies.
Of this, himself the cause, he had no right to
complain; but he had a right to complain of
the calumnies they circulated. Most rife of
these was a charge of want of courage&mdash;in Ireland
a rare and very detrimental accusation.
O'Connell, during his latter years, declined
dueling, and publicly avowed his determination.
The reason given, and given in the House of
Commons, was, that having "blood upon his
hands, he had registered a vow in heaven."
To this there could have been no possible objection
had he included in the registry a vow
not to offend. The real charge to which he
made himself amenable was his perseverance at
once in insult and irresponsibility. The truth
is, O'Connell's want of courage consisted in his
fighting the duel in which the vow originated.
The facts of the case are few and simple. In
one of his many mob speeches he called the corporation
of Dublin a "beggarly corporation."
A gentleman named D'Esterre affected to feel
this as a personal affront, he being one of that
very numerous body, and accordingly fastened
a quarrel on the offender. It is quite true that
O'Connell endeavored to avoid the encounter.
He did not do enough. He should have summoned
D'Esterre before the tribunals of the
country, after failing to appease him by a repeated
declaration that he meant him no personal
offense, and could not, he being a total stranger
to him. However, in an evil hour, he countenanced
a savage and anti-Christian custom&mdash;the
unfortunate D'Esterre paid for his perverseness
with his life, and the still more unfortunate
O'Connell expiated his moral timidity with
much mental anguish to the day of his death.
The perpetration of a duel appears to me no
proof whatever of personal courage; the refusal,
in the then state of society, would have shown
much more. However, on the occasion in question
he showed a total absence of what is vulgarly
called fear; indeed, his frigid determination
was remarkable. Let those who read the
following anecdote remember that he most reluctantly
engaged in the combat; that he was
then the father of seven children; and that it
was an alternative of life or death with him,
D'Esterre being reputed an unerring marksman.
Being one of those who accompanied O'Connell,
he beckoned me aside to a distant portion of the
very large field, which had a slight covering of
snow. "Phillips," said he, "this seems to me
not a personal, but a political affair. I am obnoxious
to a party, and they adopt a false pretense
to cut me off. I shall not submit to it.
They have reckoned without their host, I promise
you. I am one of the best shots in Ireland
at a mark, having, as a public man, considered
it a duty to prepare, for my own protection,
against such unprovoked aggression as the present.
Now, remember what I say to you. I
may be struck myself, and then skill is out of
the question; but if I am not, my antagonist
may have cause to regret his having forced me
into this conflict." The parties were then very
soon, placed on the ground, at, I think, twelve
paces distance, <i>each</i> having a case of pistols,
with directions to fire when they chose after a
given signal. D'Esterre rather agitated himself
by making a short speech, disclaiming all
hostility to his Roman Catholic countrymen, and
took his ground, somewhat theatrically crossing
his pistols upon his bosom. They fired almost
together, and instantly on the signal. D'Esterre
fell, mortally wounded. There was the greatest
self-possession displayed by both. It seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
me a duty to narrate these details in O'Connell's
lifetime wherever I heard his courage
questioned, and justice to his memory now
prompts me to record them here.</p>

<p>"Stops the action, sir!" said my father, dogmatically.</p>

<p>"Action! But a novel is not a drama."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>"Halt!" cried a voice; and not a little surprised
was Leonard when the stranger who had
accosted him the preceding evening got into the
chaise.</p>

<p>"Well," said Richard, "I am not the sort of
man you expected, eh? Take time to recover
yourself." And with these words Richard drew
forth a book from his pocket, threw himself back,
and began to read. Leonard stole many a glance
at the acute, hardy, handsome face of his companion,
and gradually recognized a family likeness
to poor John, in whom, despite age and infirmity,
the traces of no common share of physical
beauty were still evident. And with that quick
link in ideas which mathematical aptitude bestows,
the young student at once conjectured
that he saw before him his uncle Richard. He
had the discretion, however, to leave that gentleman
free to choose his own time for introducing
himself, and silently revolved the new thoughts
produced by the novelty of his situation. Mr.
Richard read with notable quickness&mdash;sometimes
cutting the leaves of the book with his penknife,
sometimes tearing them open with his forefinger,
sometimes skipping whole pages altogether.
Thus he galloped to the end of the volume&mdash;flung
it aside&mdash;lighted his cigar, and began to
talk.</p>

<p>He put many questions to Leonard relative to
his rearing, and especially to the mode by which
he had acquired his education; and Leonard,
confirmed in the idea that he was replying to a
kinsman, answered frankly.</p>

<p>Richard did not think it strange that Leonard
should have acquired so much instruction with
so little direct tuition. Richard Avenel himself
had been tutor to himself. He had lived too
long with our go-ahead brethren, who stride the
world on the other side the Atlantic with the
seven-leagued boots of the Giant-killer, not to
have caught their glorious fever for reading.
But it was for a reading wholly different from
that which was familiar to Leonard. The books
he read must be new; to read old books would
have seemed to him going back in the world.
He fancied that new books necessarily contained
new ideas&mdash;a common mistake&mdash;and our lucky
adventurer was the man of his day.</p>

<p>Tired with talking, he at length chucked the
book he had run through to Leonard, and, taking
out a pocket-book and pencil, amused himself
with calculations on some detail of his business,
after which he fell into an absorbed train of
thought&mdash;part pecuniary, part ambitious.</p>

<p>Leonard found the book interesting; it was
one of the numerous works, half-statistic, half-declamatory,
relating to the condition of the
working classes, which peculiarly distinguish
our century, and ought to bind together rich
and poor, by proving the grave attention which
modern society bestows upon all that can affect
the welfare of the last.</p>

<p>"Dull stuff&mdash;theory&mdash;claptrap," said Richard,
rousing himself from his reverie at last: "it can't
interest you."</p>

<p>"All books interest me, I think," said Leonard,
"and this especially; for it relates to the working
class, and I am one of them."</p>

<p>"You were yesterday, but you mayn't be to-morrow,"
answered Richard, good-humoredly,
and patting him on the shoulder. "You see,
my lad, that it is the middle class which ought
to govern the country. What the book says
about the ignorance of country magistrates is
very good; but the man writes pretty considerable
trash when he wants to regulate the number
of hours a free-born boy should work at a factory&mdash;only
ten hours a day&mdash;pooh! and so lose two
to the nation! Labor is wealth: and if we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
get men to work twenty-four hours a day, we
should be just twice as rich. If the march of
civilization is to proceed," continued Richard,
loftily, "men, and boys, too, must not lie a-bed
doing nothing <i>all night</i>, sir." Then with a
complacent tone&mdash;"We shall get to the twenty-four
hours at last; and, by gad, we must, or we
shan't flog the Europeans as we do now."</p>

<p>On arriving at the inn at which Richard had
first made acquaintance with Mr. Dale, the coach
by which he had intended to perform the rest of
the journey was found to be full. Richard continued
to perform the journey in post-chaises,
not without some grumbling at the expense, and
incessant orders to the post-boys to make the
best of the way. "Slow country this, in spite
of all its brag," said he&mdash;"very slow. Time is
money&mdash;they know that in the States; for why,
they are all men of business there. Always
slow in a country where a parcel of lazy, idle
lords, and dukes, and baronets, seem to think
'time is pleasure.'"</p>

<p>Toward evening the chaise approached the
confines of a very large town, and Richard began
to grow fidgety. His easy cavalier air was
abandoned. He withdrew his legs from the
window, out of which they had been luxuriously
dangling; pulled down his waistcoat; buckled
more tightly his stock: it was clear that he was
resuming the decorous dignity that belongs to
state. He was like a monarch who, after traveling
happy and incognito, returns to his capital.
Leonard divined at once that they were nearing
their journey's end.</p>

<p>Humble foot-passengers now looked at the
chaise, and touched their hats. Richard returned
the salutation with a nod&mdash;a nod less gracious
than condescending. The chaise turned rapidly
to the left, and stopped before a smart lodge,
very new, very white, adorned with two Doric
columns in stucco, and flanked by a large pair
of gates. "Hollo!" cried the post-boy, and
cracked his whip.</p>

<p>Two children were playing before the lodge,
and some clothes were hanging out to dry on the
shrubs and pales round the neat little building.</p>

<p>"Hang those brats! they are actually playing,"
growled Dick. "As I live, the jade has
been washing again! Stop, boy." During this
soliloquy, a good-looking young woman had
rushed from the door&mdash;slapped the children as,
catching sight of the chaise, they ran toward
the house&mdash;opened the gates, and, dropping a
courtesy to the ground, seemed to wish that she
could drop into it altogether, so frightened and
so trembling seemed she to shrink from the
wrathful face which the master now put out of
the window.</p>

<p>"Did I tell you, or did I not," said Dick,
"that I would not have these horrid disreputable
cubs of yours playing just before my lodge
gates?"</p>

<p>"Please, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't answer me. And did I tell you, or
did I not, that the next time I saw you making
a drying-ground of my lilacs, you should go out,
neck and crop&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, please, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You leave my lodge next Saturday: drive
on, boy. The ingratitude and insolence of those
common people are disgraceful to human nature,"
muttered Richard, with an accent of the
bitterest misanthropy.</p>

<p>The chaise wheeled along the smoothest and
freshest of gravel roads, and through fields of
the finest land, in the highest state of cultivation.
Rapid as was Leonard's survey, his rural
eye detected the signs of a master in the art
agranomial. Hitherto he had considered the
Squire's model farm as the nearest approach to
good husbandry he had seen: for Jackeymo's
finer skill was developed rather on the minute
scale of market-gardening than what can fairly
be called husbandry. But the Squire's farm
was degraded by many old-fashioned notions,
and concessions to the whim of the eye, which
would not be found in model farms nowadays&mdash;large
tangled hedgerows, which, though they
constitute one of the beauties most picturesque
in old England, make sad deductions from produce;
great trees, overshadowing the corn, and
harboring the birds; little patches of rough
sward left to waste; and angles of woodland
running into fields, exposing them to rabbits,
and blocking out the sun. These and suchlike
blots on a gentleman farmer's agriculture, common-sense
and Giacomo had made clear to the
acute comprehension of Leonard. No such faults
were perceptible in Richard Avenel's domain.
The fields lay in broad divisions, the hedges
were clipped and narrowed into their proper
destination of mere boundaries. Not a blade of
wheat withered under the cold shade of a tree:
not a yard of land lay waste; not a weed was
to be seen, not a thistle to waft its baleful seed
through the air: some young plantations were
placed, not where the artist would put them, but
just where the farmer wanted a fence from the
wind. Was there no beauty in this? Yes, there
was beauty of its kind&mdash;beauty at once recognizable
to the initiated&mdash;beauty of use and profit&mdash;beauty
that could bear a monstrous high rent.
And Leonard uttered a cry of admiration which
thrilled through the heart of Richard Avenel.</p>

<p>"This <i>is</i> farming!" said the villager.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess it is," answered Richard, all
his ill-humor vanishing. "You should have
seen the land when I bought it. But we new
men, as they call us&mdash;(damn their impertinence)&mdash;are
the new blood of this country."</p>

<p>Richard Avenel never said any thing more
true. Long may the new blood circulate through
the veins of the mighty giantess; but let the
grand heart be the same as it has beat for proud
ages.</p>

<p>The chaise, now passed through a pretty
shrubbery, and the house came into gradual
view&mdash;a house with a portico&mdash;all the offices
carefully thrust out of sight.</p>

<p>The post-boy dismounted and rang the bell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"I almost think they are going to keep me
waiting," said Mr. Richard, well-nigh in the
very words of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>But that fear was not realized&mdash;the door opened;
a well-fed servant out of livery presented
himself. There was no hearty welcoming smile
on his face, but he opened the chaise-door with
demure and taciturn respect.</p>

<p>"Where's George? why does not he come to
the door?" asked Richard, descending from the
chaise slowly, and leaning on the servant's outstretched
arm with as much precaution as if he
had had the gout.</p>

<p>Fortunately, George here came into sight,
settling himself hastily into his livery coat.</p>

<p>"See to the things, both of you," said Richard,
as he paid the post-boy.</p>

<p>Leonard stood on the gravel sweep, gazing at
the square white house.</p>

<p>"Handsome elevation&mdash;classical, I take it&mdash;eh?"
said Richard, joining him. "But you
should see the offices."</p>

<p>He then, with familiar kindness, took Leonard
by the arm, and drew him within. He showed
him the hall, with a carved mahogany stand for
hats; he showed him the drawing-room, and
pointed out its beauties&mdash;though it was summer
the drawing-room looked cold, as will look rooms
newly furnished, with walls newly papered, in
houses newly built. The furniture was handsome,
and suited to the rank of a rich trader.
There was no pretense about it, and therefore
no vulgarity, which is more than can be said for
the houses of many an honorable Mrs. Somebody
in Mayfair, with rooms twelve feet square, chokeful
of buhl, that would have had its proper place
in the Tuileries. Then Richard showed him the
library, with mahogany book-cases and plate
glass, and the fashionable authors handsomely
bound. Your new men are much better friends
to living authors than your old families who live
in the country, and at most subscribe to a book-club.
Then Richard took him up-stairs, and led
him through the bedrooms&mdash;all very clean and
comfortable, and with every modern convenience;
and, pausing in a very pretty single gentleman's
chamber, said, "This is your den.
And now, can you guess who I am?"</p>

<p>"No one but my Uncle Richard could be so
kind," answered Leonard.</p>

<p>But the compliment did not flatter Richard.
He was extremely disconcerted and disappointed.
He had hoped that he should be taken for
a lord at least, forgetful of all that he had said
in disparagement of lords.</p>

<p>"Pish!" said he at last, biting his lip&mdash;"so
you don't think that I look like a gentleman!
Come, now, speak honestly."</p>

<p>Leonard wonderingly saw he had given pain,
and with the good breeding which comes instinctively
from good-nature, replied&mdash;"I judged
you by your heart, sir, and your likeness to my
grandfather&mdash;otherwise I should never have presumed
to fancy we could be relations."</p>

<p>"Hum!" answered Richard. "You can just
wash your hands, and then come down to dinner;
you will hear the gong in ten minutes.
There's the bell; ring for what you want."</p>

<p>With that, he turned on his heel; and descending
the stairs, gave a look into the dining-room,
and admired the plated salver on the sideboard,
and the king's pattern spoons and forks on the
table. Then he walked to the looking-glass
over the mantle-piece; and wishing to survey
the whole effect of his form, mounted a chair.
He was just getting into an attitude which he
thought imposing, when the butler entered, and
being London bred, had the discretion to try to
escape unseen; but Richard caught sight of him
in the looking-glass, and colored up to the temples.</p>

<p>"Jarvis," said he mildly, "Jarvis, put me in
mind to have these inexpressibles altered."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>Apropos of the inexpressibles, Mr. Richard
did not forget to provide his nephew with a much
larger wardrobe than could have been thrust
into Dr. Riccabocca's knapsack. There was a
very good tailor in the town, and the clothes were
very well made. And, but for an air more ingenuous,
and a cheek that, despite study and
night vigils, retained much of the sunburnt bloom
of the rustic, Leonard Fairfield might now have
almost passed, without disparaging comment,
by the bow-window at White's. Richard burst
into an immoderate fit of laughter when he first
saw the watch which the poor Italian had bestowed
upon Leonard; but, to atone for the
laughter, he made him a present of a very pretty
substitute, and bade him "lock up his turnip."
Leonard was more hurt by the jeer at his old
patron's gift than pleased by his uncle's. But
Richard Avenel had no conception of sentiment.
It was not for many days that Leonard could
reconcile himself to his uncle's manner. Not
that the peasant could pretend to judge of its
mere conventional defects; but there is an ill
breeding to which, whatever our rank and nurture,
we are almost equally sensitive&mdash;the ill
breeding that comes from want of consideration
for others. Now, the Squire was as homely in
his way as Richard Avenel, but the Squire's
bluntness rarely hurt the feelings: and when it
did so, the Squire perceived and hastened to repair
his blunder. But Mr. Richard, whether
kind or cross, was always wounding you in some
little delicate fibre&mdash;not from malice, but from
the absence of any little delicate fibres of his
own. He was really, in many respects, a most
excellent man and certainly a very valuable,
citizen. But his merits wanted the fine tints and
fluent curves that constitute beauty of character.
He was honest, but sharp in his practice, and
with a keen eye to his interests. He was just,
but as a matter of business. He made no allowances,
and did not leave to his justice the
large margin of tenderness and mercy. He was
generous, but rather from an idea of what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
due to himself than with much thought of the
pleasure he gave to others; and he even regarded
generosity as capital put out to interest. He
expected a great deal of gratitude in return, and,
when he obliged a man, considered that he had
bought a slave. Every needy voter knew where
to come, if he wanted relief or a loan; but woe
to him if he had ventured to express hesitation
when Mr. Avenel told him how he must vote.</p>

<p>In this town Richard had settled after his return
from America, in which country he had
enriched himself&mdash;first, by spirit and industry&mdash;lastly,
by bold speculation and good luck. He
invested his fortune in business&mdash;became a partner
in a large brewery&mdash;soon bought out his
associates&mdash;and then took a principal share in a
flourishing corn-mill. He prospered rapidly&mdash;bought
a property of some two or three hundred
acres, built a house, and resolved to enjoy himself,
and make a figure. He had now become
the leading man of the town, and the boast to
Audley Egerton that he could return one of the
members, perhaps both, was by no means an
exaggerated estimate of his power. Nor was
his proposition, according to his own views, so
unprincipled as it appeared to the statesman.
He had taken a great dislike to both the sitting
members&mdash;a dislike natural to a sensible man of
modern politics, who had something to lose. For
Mr. Slappe, the active member&mdash;who was head-over-ears
in debt&mdash;was one of the furious democrats
rare before the Reform Bill&mdash;and whose
opinions were held dangerous even by the mass
of a Liberal constituency; while Mr. Sleekie,
the gentleman member, who laid by &pound;5000
every year from his dividends in the Funds, was
one of those men whom Richard justly pronounced
to be "humbugs"&mdash;men who curry
favor with the extreme party by voting for
measures sure not to be carried; while, if there
were the least probability of coming to a decision
that would lower the money-market, Mr.
Sleekie was seized with a well-timed influenza.
Those politicians are common enough now. Propose
to march to the Millennium, and they are
your men. Ask them to march a quarter of a
mile, and they fall to feeling their pockets, and
trembling for fear of the foot-pads. They are
never so joyful as when there is no chance of a
victory. Did they beat the Minister, they would
be carried out of the house in a fit.</p>

<p>Richard Avenel&mdash;despising both these gentlemen,
and not taking kindly to the Whigs since
the great Whig leaders were Lords&mdash;looked
with a friendly eye to the Government as it then
existed, and especially to Audley Egerton, the
enlightened representative of commerce. But
in giving Audley and his colleagues the benefit
of his influence, through conscience, he thought
it all fair and right to have a <i>quid pro quo</i>, and,
as he had so frankly confessed, it was his whim
to rise up "Sir Richard." For this worthy citizen
abused the aristocracy much on the same
principle as the fair Olivia depreciated Squire
Thornhill&mdash;he had a sneaking affection for what
he abused. The society of Screwstown was
like most provincial capitals, composed of two
classes&mdash;the commercial and the exclusive.
These last dwelt chiefly apart, around the ruins
of an old abbey; they affected its antiquity in
their pedigrees, and had much of its ruin in their
finances. Widows of rural thanes in the neighborhood&mdash;genteel
spinsters&mdash;officers retired on
half-pay&mdash;younger sons of rich squires, who had
now become old bachelors&mdash;in short, a very respectable,
proud, aristocratic set&mdash;who thought
more of themselves than do all the Gowers and
Howards, Courtenays and Seymours, put together.
It had early been the ambition of Richard
Avenel to be admitted into this sublime coterie,
and, strange to say, he had partially succeeded.
He was never more happy than when
he was asked to their card-parties, and never
more unhappy than when he was actually there.
Various circumstances combined to raise Mr.
Avenel into this elevated society. First, he
was unmarried, still very handsome, and in that
society there was a large proportion of unwedded
females. Secondly, he was the only rich
trader in Screwstown who kept a good cook,
and professed to give dinners, and the half-pay
captains and colonels swallowed the host for the
sake of the venison. Thirdly, and principally,
all these exclusives abhorred the two sitting
members, and "idem nolle idem velle de republica,
ea firma amicitia est;" that is, congeniality
in politics pieces porcelain and crockery together
better than the best diamond cement. The
sturdy Richard Avenel&mdash;who valued himself on
American independence&mdash;held these ladies and
gentlemen in an awe that was truly Brahminical.
Whether it was that in England, all notions, even
of liberty, are mixed up historically, traditionally,
socially, with that fine and subtle element of
aristocracy which, like the press, is the air we
breathe; or whether Richard imagined that he
really became magnetically imbued with the
virtues of these silver pennies and gold seven-shilling
pieces, distinct from the vulgar coinage
in popular use, it is hard to say. But the truth
must be told&mdash;Richard Avenel was a notable
tuft-hunter. He had a great longing to marry
out of this society; but he had not yet seen any
one sufficiently high-born and high-bred to satisfy
his aspirations. In the mean while, he had
convinced himself that his way would be smooth
could he offer to make his ultimate choice "My
Lady;" and he felt that it would be a proud
hour in his life when he could walk before stiff
Colonel Pompley to the sound of "Sir Richard."
Still, however disappointed at the ill-success of
his bluff diplomacy with Mr. Egerton, and however
yet cherishing the most vindictive resentment
against that individual&mdash;he did not, as
many would have done, throw up his political
convictions out of personal spite. He resolved
still to favor the ungrateful and undeserving
Administration; and as Audley Egerton had
acted on the representations of the mayor and
deputies, and shaped his bill to meet their views,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
so Avenel and the Government rose together in
the popular estimation of the citizens of Screwstown.</p>

<p>But duly to appreciate the value of Richard
Avenel, and in just counterpoise to all his foibles,
one ought to have seen what he had effected for
the town. Well might he boast of "new blood;"
he had done as much for the town as he had for
his fields. His energy, his quick comprehension
of public utility, backed by his wealth, and bold,
bullying, imperious character, had sped the work
of civilization as if with the celerity and force of
a steam-engine.</p>

<p>If the town were so well paved and so well
lighted&mdash;if half-a-dozen squalid lanes had been
transformed into a stately street&mdash;if half the
town no longer depended on tanks for their water&mdash;if
the poor-rates were reduced one-third&mdash;praise
to the brisk new blood which Richard
Avenel had infused into vestry and corporation.
And his example itself was so contagious!
"There was not a plate-glass window in the
town when I came into it," said Richard Avenel;
"and now look down the High-street!" He took
the credit to himself, and justly; for, though his
own business did not require windows of plate-glass,
he had awakened the spirit of enterprise
which adorns a whole city.</p>

<p>Mr. Avenel did not present Leonard to his
friends for more than a fortnight. He allowed
him to wear off his rust. He then gave a grand
dinner, at which his nephew was formally introduced,
and, to his great wrath and disappointment,
never opened his lips. How could he,
poor youth, when Miss Clarina Mowbray only
talked upon high life, till proud Colonel Pompley
went in state through the history of the siege
of Seringapatam.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>While Leonard accustoms himself gradually
to the splendors that surround him, and often
turns with a sigh to the remembrance of his
mother's cottage and the sparkling fount in the
Italian's flowery garden, we will make with
thee, O reader, a rapid flight to the metropolis,
and drop ourselves amidst the gay groups that
loiter along the dusty ground, or loll over the
roadside palings of Hyde Park. The season is
still at its height; but the short day of fashionable
London life, which commences two hours
after noon, is in its decline. The crowd in Rotten-row
begins to thin. Near the statue of
Achilles, and apart from all other loungers, a
gentleman, with one hand thrust into his waistcoat,
and the other resting on his cane, gazed
listlessly on the horsemen and carriages in the
brilliant ring. He was still in the prime of life,
at the age when man is usually the most social&mdash;when
the acquaintances of youth have ripened
into friendship, and a personage of some rank
and fortune has become a well-known feature in
the mobile face of society. But though, when
his contemporaries were boys scarce at college,
this gentleman had blazed foremost among the
princes of fashion, and though he had all the
qualities of nature and circumstance which
either retain fashion to the last, or exchange its
false celebrity for a graver repute, he stood as
a stranger in that throng of his countrymen.
Beauties whirled by to the toilet&mdash;statesmen
passed on to the senate&mdash;dandies took flight to
the clubs; and neither nods, nor becks, nor
wreathed smiles, said to the solitary spectator,
"Follow us&mdash;thou art one of our set." Now
and then, some middle-aged beau, nearing the
post of the loiterer, turned round to look again;
but the second glance seemed to dissipate the
recognition of the first, and the beau silently
continued his way.</p>

<p>"By the tombs of my fathers!" said the solitary
to himself, "I know now what a dead man
might feel if he came to life again, and took a
peep at the living."</p>

<p>Time passed on&mdash;the evening shades descended
fast. Our stranger in London had well-nigh
the Park to himself. He seemed to breathe
more freely as he saw that the space was so
clear.</p>

<p>"There's oxygen in the atmosphere now,"
said he, half aloud; "and I can walk without
breathing in the gaseous fumes of the multitude.
O those chemists&mdash;what dolts they are! They
tell us crowds taint the air, but they never guess
why! Pah! it is not the lungs that poison the
element&mdash;it is the reek of bad hearts. When a
periwig-pated fellow breathes on me, I swallow
a mouthful of care. <i>Allons!</i> my friend Nero;
now for a stroll." He touched with his cane a
large Newfoundland dog, who lay stretched
near his feet; a dog and man went slow through
the growing twilight, and over the brown dry
turf. At length our solitary paused, and threw
himself on a bench under a tree. "Half-past
eight!" said he, looking at his watch&mdash;"one
may smoke one's cigar without shocking the
world."</p>

<p>He took out his cigar-case, struck a light, and
in another moment, reclined at length on the
bench, seemed absorbed in regarding the smoke,
that scarce colored ere it vanished into air.</p>

<p>"It is the most barefaced lie in the world, my
Nero," said he, addressing his dog&mdash;"this boasted
liberty of man! Now, here am I, a freeborn
Englishman, a citizen of the world, caring&mdash;I
often say to myself&mdash;caring not a jot for Kaisar
or Mob; and yet I no more dare smoke this
cigar in the Park at half-past six, when all the
world is abroad, than I dare pick my Lord
Chancellor's pocket, or hit the Archbishop of
Canterbury a thump on the nose. Yet no law
in England forbids me my cigar, Nero! What
is law at half-past eight, was not crime at six
and a half! Britannia says, "Man, thou art
free," and she lies like a commonplace woman.
O Nero, Nero! you enviable dog!&mdash;you serve
but from liking. No thought of the world costs
you one wag of the tail. Your big heart and
true instinct suffice you for reason and law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
You would want nothing to your felicity, if in
these moments of ennui you would but smoke a
cigar. Try it, Nero!&mdash;try it!" And, rising
from his incumbent posture, he sought to force
the end of the weed between the teeth of the
dog.</p>

<p>While thus gravely engaged, two figures had
approached the place. The one was a man
who seemed weak and sickly. His threadbare
coat was buttoned to the chin, but hung large
on his shrunken breast. The other was a girl
of about fourteen, on whose arm he leant heavily.
Her cheek was wan, and there was a patient
sad look on her face, which seemed so settled
that you would think she could never have
known the mirthfulness of childhood.</p>

<p>"Pray rest here, papa," said the child softly;
and she pointed to the bench, without taking
heed of its pre-occupant, who now, indeed, confined
to one corner of the seat, was almost hidden
by the shadow of a tree.</p>

<p>The man sate down, with a feeble sigh; and
then, observing the stranger, raised his hat, and
said, in that tone of voice which betrays the
usages of polished society, "Forgive me, if I intrude
on you, sir."</p>

<p>The stranger looked up from his dog, and
seeing that the girl was standing, rose at once
as if to make room for her on the bench.</p>

<p>But still the girl did not heed him. She hung
over her father, and wiped his brow tenderly
with a little kerchief which she took from her
own neck for the purpose.</p>

<p>Nero, delighted to escape the cigar, had taken
to some unwieldy curvets and gambols, to vent
the excitement into which he had been thrown;
and now returning, approached the bench with
a low look of surprise, and sniffed at the intruders
on his master's privacy.</p>

<p>"Come here, sir," said the master. "You
need not fear him," he added, addressing himself
to the girl.</p>

<p>But the girl, without turning round to him,
cried in a voice rather of anguish than alarm,
"He has fainted! Father! father!"</p>

<p>The stranger kicked aside his dog, which
was in the way, and loosened the poor man's
stiff military stock. While thus charitably engaged,
the moon broke out, and the light fell
full on the pale care-worn face of the unconscious
sufferer.</p>

<p>"This face seems not unfamiliar to me,
though sadly changed," said the stranger to
himself; and bending toward the girl, who had
sunk on her knees and was chafing her father's
hands, he asked, "My child, what is your father's
name?"</p>

<p>The child continued her task, too absorbed to
answer.</p>

<p>The stranger put his hand on her shoulder,
and repeated the question.</p>

<p>"Digby," answered the child, almost unconsciously;
and as she spoke the man's senses
began to return. In a few minutes more he
had sufficiently recovered to falter forth his
thanks to the stranger. But the last took his
hand, and said, in a voice at once tremulous and
soothing, "Is it possible that I see once more an
old brother in arms? Algernon Digby, I do not
forget you; but it seems England has forgotten?"</p>

<p>A hectic flush spread over the soldier's face,
and he looked away from the speaker as he
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"My name is Digby, it is true, sir; but I do
not think we have met before. Come, Helen, I
am well now&mdash;we will go home."</p>

<p>"Try and play with that great dog, my
child," said the stranger&mdash;"I want to talk with
your father."</p>

<p>The child bowed her submissive head, and
moved away; but she did not play with the
dog.</p>

<p>"I must re-introduce myself, formally, I see,"
quoth the stranger. "You were in the same
regiment with myself, and my name is L'Estrange."</p>

<p>"My lord," said the soldier, rising, "forgive
me that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think that it was the fashion to call
me 'my lord' at the mess-table. Come, what
has happened to you?&mdash;on half-pay?"</p>

<p>Mr. Digby shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>"Digby, old fellow, can you lend me &pound;100?"
said Lord L'Estrange, clapping his <i>ci-devant</i>
brother officer on the shoulder, and in a tone of
voice that seemed like a boy's&mdash;so impudent
was it, and devil-me-carish. "No! Well, that's
lucky, for I can lend it to you."</p>

<p>Mr. Digby burst into tears.</p>

<p>Lord L'Estrange did not seem to observe the
emotion. "We were both sad extravagant fellows
in our day," said he, "and I dare say I
borrowed of you pretty freely."</p>

<p>"Me! Oh, Lord L'Estrange?"</p>

<p>"You have married since then, and reformed,
I suppose. Tell me, old friend, all about it."</p>

<p>Mr. Digby, who by this time had succeeded
in restoring some calm to his shattered nerves,
now rose, and said in brief sentences, but clear
firm tones,</p>

<p>"My Lord, it is idle to talk of me&mdash;useless to
help me. I am fast dying. But, my child there,
my only child (he paused an instant, and went
on rapidly). I have relations in a distant country,
if I could but get to them&mdash;I think they
would at least provide for her. This has been
for weeks my hope, my dream, my prayer. I
can not afford the journey except by your help.
I have begged without shame for myself; shall
I be ashamed, then, to beg for her?"</p>

<p>"Digby," said L'Estrange, with some grave
alteration of manner, "talk neither of dying, nor
begging. You were nearer death when the balls
whistled round you at Waterloo. If soldier meets
soldier and says, 'Friend, thy purse,' it is not
begging, but brotherhood. Ashamed! By the
soul of Belisarius! if I needed money, I would
stand at a crossing with my Waterloo medal
over my breast, and say to each sleek citizen I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
had helped to save from the sword of the Frenchman,
'It is your shame if I starve.' Now, lean
upon me; I see you should be at home&mdash;which
way?"</p>

<p>The poor soldier pointed his hand toward Oxford-street,
and reluctantly accepted the proffered
arm.</p>

<p>"And when you return from your relations,
you will call on me? What!&mdash;hesitate? Come,
promise."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"On your honor."</p>

<p>"If I live, on my honor."</p>

<p>"I am staying at present at Knightsbridge,
with my father; but you will always hear of
my address at No. &mdash; Grosvenor-square, Mr.
Egerton's. So you have a long journey before
you?"</p>

<p>"Very long."</p>

<p>"Do not fatigue yourself&mdash;travel slowly. Ho,
you foolish child!&mdash;I see you are jealous of me.
Your father has another arm to spare you."</p>

<p>Thus talking, and getting but short answers,
Lord L'Estrange continued to exhibit those
whimsical peculiarities of character, which had
obtained for him the repute of heartlessness in
the world. Perhaps the reader may think the
world was not in the right. But if ever the
world does judge rightly of the character of a
man who does not live for the world, nor talk
for the world, nor feel with the world, it will be
centuries after the soul of Harley L'Estrange
has done with this planet.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>Lord L'Estrange parted company with Mr.
Digby at the entrance of Oxford-street. The
father and child there took a cabriolet. Mr.
Digby directed the driver to go down the
Edgeware-road. He refused to tell L'Estrange
his address, and this with such evident pain,
from the sores of pride, that L'Estrange could
not press the point. Reminding the soldier of
his promise to call, Harley thrust a pocket-book
into his hand, and walked off hastily toward
Grosvenor-square.</p>

<p>He reached Audley Egerton's door just as
that gentleman was getting out of his carriage;
and the two friends entered the house together.</p>

<p>"Does the nation take a nap to-night?" asked
L'Estrange. "Poor old lady! She hears so
much of her affairs, that she may well boast of
her constitution: it must be of iron."</p>

<p>"The House is still sitting," answered Audley
seriously, and with small heed of his friend's
witticism. "But it is not a Government motion,
and the division will be late, so I came home;
and if I had not found you here, I should have
gone into the Park to look for you."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;one always knows where to find me
at this hour. 9 o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;cigar&mdash;Hyde Park.
There is not a man in England so regular in his
habits."</p>

<p>Here the friends reached a drawing-room in
which the Member of Parliament seldom sat,
for his private apartments were all on the
ground floor.</p>

<p>"But it is the strangest whim of yours, Harley,"
said he.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"To affect detestation of ground-floors."</p>

<p>"Affect! O sophisticated man, of the earth,
earthy! Affect!&mdash;nothing less natural to the
human soul than a ground-floor. We are quite
far enough from heaven, mount as many stairs
as we will, without groveling by preference."</p>

<p>"According to that symbolical view of the
case," said Audley, "you should lodge in an
attic."</p>

<p>"So I would, but that I abhor new slippers.
As for hair-brushes, I am indifferent!"</p>

<p>"What have slippers and hair-brushes to do
with attics?"</p>

<p>"Try! Make your bed in an attic, and the
next morning you will have neither slippers nor
hair-brushes!"</p>

<p>"What shall I have done with them?"</p>

<p>"Shied them at the cats!"</p>

<p>"What odd things you do say, Harley!"</p>

<p>"Odd! By Apollo and his nine spinsters!
there is no human being who has so little imagination
as a distinguished Member of Parliament.
Answer me this, thou solemn right
honorable&mdash;Hast thou climbed to the heights
of august contemplation? Hast thou gazed on
the stars with the rapt eye of song? Hast thou
dreamed of a love known to the angels, or
sought to seize in the Infinite the mystery of
life?"</p>

<p>"Not I indeed, my poor Harley."</p>

<p>"Then no wonder, poor Audley, that you can
not conjecture why he who makes his bed in an
attic, disturbed by base catterwauls, shies his
slippers at cats. Bring a chair into the balcony.
Nero spoiled my cigar to-night. I am going to
smoke now. You never smoke. You can look
on the shrubs in the square."</p>

<p>Audley slightly shrugged his shoulders, but
he followed his friend's counsel and example,
and brought his chair into the balcony. Nero
came too, but at sight and smell of the cigar
prudently retreated, and took refuge under the
table.</p>

<p>"Audley Egerton, I want something from
Government."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear it."</p>

<p>"There was a cornet in my regiment, who
would have done better not to have come into it.
We were, for the most part of us, puppies and
fops."</p>

<p>"You all fought well, however."</p>

<p>"Puppies and fops do fight well. Vanity
and valor generally go together. C&aelig;sar, who
scratched his head with due care of his scanty
curls, and, even in dying, thought of the folds in
his toga; Walter Raleigh, who could not walk
twenty yards, because of the gems in his shoes;
Alcibiades, who lounged into the Agora with
doves in his bosom, and an apple in his hand;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Murat, bedizened in gold-lace and furs; and
Demetrius, the City-Taker, who made himself
up like a French <i>Marquise</i>&mdash;were all pretty
good fellows at fighting. A slovenly hero like
Cromwell is a paradox in nature, and a marvel
in history. But to return to my cornet. We
were rich; he was poor. When the pot of clay
swims down the stream with the brass-pots, it
is sure of a smash. Men said Digby was stingy;
I saw he was extravagant. But every one, I
fear, would be rather thought stingy than poor.
<i>Bref.</i>&mdash;I left the army, and saw him no more
till to-night. There was never shabby poor
gentleman on the stage more awfully shabby,
more pathetically gentleman. But, look ye,
this man has fought for England. It was no
child's play at Waterloo, let me tell you, Mr.
Egerton; and, but for such men, you would be
at best a <i>sous-prefet</i>, and your Parliament a
Provincial Assembly. You must do something
for Digby. What shall it be?"</p>

<p>"Why, really, my dear Harley, this man was
no great friend of yours&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"If he were, he would not want the Government
to help him&mdash;he would not be ashamed of
taking money from me."</p>

<p>"That is all very fine, Harley; but there are
so many poor officers, and so little to give. It
is the most difficult thing in the world that which
you ask me. Indeed, I know nothing can be
done; he has his half-pay."</p>

<p>"I think not; or, if he has it, no doubt it all
goes on his debts. That's nothing to us: the
man and his child are starving."</p>

<p>"But if it is his own fault&mdash;if he has been
imprudent?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;well, well; where the devil is Nero?"</p>

<p>"I am so sorry I can't oblige you. If it were
any thing else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is something else. My valet&mdash;I can't
turn him adrift&mdash;excellent fellow, but gets drunk
now and then. Will you find him a place in the
Stamp Office?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure."</p>

<p>"No, now I think of it&mdash;the man knows my
ways: I must keep him. But my old wine-merchant&mdash;civil
man, never dunned&mdash;is a bankrupt.
I am under great obligations to him, and
he has a very pretty daughter. Do you think
you could thrust him into some small place in
the colonies, or make him a king's messenger,
or something of the sort?"</p>

<p>"If you very much wish it, no doubt I
can."</p>

<p>"My dear Audley, I am but feeling my way:
the fact is, I want something for myself."</p>

<p>"Ah, that indeed gives me pleasure!" cried
Egerton, with animation.</p>

<p>"The mission to Florence will soon be vacant&mdash;I
know it privately. The place would quite
suit me. Pleasant city; the best figs in Italy&mdash;very
little to do. You could sound Lord &mdash;&mdash; on
the subject."</p>

<p>"I will answer beforehand. Lord &mdash;&mdash; would
be enchanted to secure to the public service a
man so accomplished as yourself, and the son of
a peer like Lord Lansmere."</p>

<p>Harley L'Estrange sprang to his feet, and
flung his cigar in the face of a stately policeman,
who was looking up at the balcony.</p>

<p>"Infamous and bloodless official!" cried Harley
L'Estrange; "so you could provide for a
pimpled-nosed lackey&mdash;for a wine-merchant who
has been poisoning the king's subjects with white
lead or sloe-juice&mdash;for an idle sybarite, who
would complain of a crumpled rose-leaf; and
nothing in all the vast patronage of England for
a broken down soldier, whose dauntless breast
was her rampart."</p>

<p>"Harley," said the Member of Parliament,
with his calm, sensible smile, "this would be
very good clap-trap at a small theatre; but there
is nothing in which Parliament demands such
rigid economy as the military branch of the
public service; and no man for whom it is so
hard to effect what we must plainly call a job,
as a subaltern officer, who has done nothing
more than his duty&mdash;and all military men do
that. Still, as you take it so earnestly, I will
use what interest I can at the War Office, and
get him, perhaps, the mastership of a barrack."</p>

<p>"You had better; for, if you do not, I swear
I will turn radical, and come down to your own
city to oppose you, with Hunt and Cobbett to
canvass for me."</p>

<p>"I should be very glad to see you come into
parliament, even as a radical, and at my expense,"
said Audley, with great kindness. "But
the air is growing cold, and you are not accustomed
to our climate. Nay, if you are too
poetic for catarrhs and rheums, I'm not&mdash;come
in."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>Lord L'Estrange threw himself on a sofa,
and leaned his cheek on his hand thoughtfully.
Audley Egerton sat near him, with his arms
folded, and gazed on his friend's face with a
soft expression of aspect, which was very unusual
to the firm outline of his handsome features.
The two men were as dissimilar in person
as the reader will have divined that they
were in character. All about Egerton was so
rigid, all about L'Estrange so easy. In every
posture of Harley's there was the unconscious
grace of a child. The very fashion of his garments
showed his abhorrence of restraint. His
clothes were wide and loose; his neckcloth, tied
carelessly, left his throat half bare. You could
see that he had lived much in warm and southern
lands, and contracted a contempt for conventionalities;
there was as little in his dress as in
his talk of the formal precision of the north. He
was three or four years younger then Audley,
but he looked at least twelve years younger. In
fact, he was one of those men to whom old age
seems impossible&mdash;voice, look, figure, had all
the charm of youth; and, perhaps it was from
this gracious youthfulness&mdash;at all events, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
characteristic of the kind of love he inspired&mdash;that
neither his parents, nor the few friends admitted
into his intimacy, ever called him, in their
habitual intercourse, by the name of his title.
He was not L'Estrange with them, he was Harley;
and by that familiar baptismal I will usually
designate him. He was not one of those men
whom author or reader wish to view at a distance,
and remember as "my Lord"&mdash;it was so rarely
that he remembered it himself. For the rest, it
had been said of him by a shrewd wit&mdash;"He is
so natural that every one calls him affected."
Harley L'Estrange was not so critically handsome
as Audley Egerton; to a commonplace
observer he was, at best, rather good-looking
than otherwise. But women said that he had
"a beautiful countenance," and they were not
wrong. He wore his hair, which was of a fair
chestnut, long, and in loose curls; and instead
of the Englishman's whiskers, indulged in the
foreigner's mustache. His complexion was delicate,
though not effeminate; it was rather the
delicacy of a student, than of a woman. But in
his clear gray eye there was wonderful vigor
of life. A skillful physiologist, looking only into
that eye, would have recognized rare stamina
of constitution&mdash;a nature so rich that, while
easily disturbed, it would require all the effects
of time, or all the fell combinations of passion
and grief, to exhaust it. Even now, though so
thoughtful, and even so sad, the rays of that eye
were as concentred and steadfast as the light of
the diamond.</p>

<p>"You were only, then, in jest," said Audley,
after a long silence, "when you spoke of this
mission to Florence. You have still no idea of
entering into public life."</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"I had hoped better things when I got your
promise to pass one season in London. But, indeed,
you have kept your promise to the ear to
break it to the spirit. I could not presuppose
that you would shun all society, and be as much
of a hermit here as under the vines of Como."</p>

<p>"I have sate in the Strangers' Gallery, and
heard your great speakers; I have been in the
pit of the Opera, and seen your fine ladies; I
have walked your streets, I have lounged in your
parks, and I say that I can't fall in love with a
faded dowager, because she fills up her wrinkless
with rouge."</p>

<p>"Of what dowager do you speak?" asked the
matter-of-fact Audley.</p>

<p>"She has a great many titles. Some people
call her fashion, you busy men, politics: it is all
one&mdash;tricked out and artificial. I mean London
life. No, I can't fall in love with her, fawning
old harridan!"</p>

<p>"I wish you could fall in love with something."</p>

<p>"I wish I could, with all my heart."</p>

<p>"But you are so <i>blas&eacute;</i>."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I am so fresh. Look out
of the window&mdash;what do you see?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing but houses and dusty lilacs, my
coachman dozing on his box, and two women in
pattens crossing the kennel."</p>

<p>"I see none of that where I lie on the sofa.
I see but the stars. And I feel for them as I
did when I was a schoolboy at Eton. It is you
who are <i>blas&eacute;</i>, not I&mdash;enough of this. You do
not forget my commission, with respect to
the exile who has married into your brother's
family?"</p>

<p>"No; but here you set me a task more difficult
than that of saddling your cornet on the
War Office."</p>

<p>"I know it is difficult, for the counter influence
is vigilant and strong; but on the other
hand, the enemy is so damnable a traitor that
one must have the Fates and the household gods
on one's side."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said the practical Audley,
bending over a book on the table, "I think that
the best plan would be to attempt a compromise
with the traitor."</p>

<p>"To judge of others by myself," answered
Harley with spirit, "it were less bitter to put
up with wrong than to palter with it for compensation.
And such wrong! Compromise with
the open foe&mdash;that may be done with honor; but
with the perjured friend&mdash;that were to forgive
the perjury!"</p>

<p>"You are too vindictive," said Egerton;
"there may be excuses for the friend, which
palliate even&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! Audley, hush! or I shall think the
world has indeed corrupted you. Excuse for
the friend who deceives, who betrays! No, such
is the true outlaw of Humanity; and the Furies
surround him even while he sleeps in the temple."</p>

<p>The man of the world lifted his eye slowly on
the animated face of one still natural enough for
the passions. He then once more returned to
his book, and said, after a pause, "It is time you
should marry, Harley."</p>

<p>"No," answered L'Estrange, with a smile at
this sudden turn in the conversation&mdash;"not time
yet; for my chief objection to that change in life
is, that all the women nowadays are too old
for me, or I am too young for them; a few, indeed,
are so infantine that one is ashamed to be
their toy; but most are so knowing that one is
a fool to be their dupe. The first, if they condescend
to love you, love you as the biggest doll
they have yet dandled, and for a doll's good qualities&mdash;your
pretty blue eyes, and your exquisite
millinery. The last, if they prudently accept
you, do so on algebraical principles; you are
but the X or the Y that represents a certain aggregate
of goods matrimonial&mdash;pedigree, title,
rent-roll, diamonds, pin-money, opera-box. They
cast you up with the help of mamma, and you
wake some morning to find that <i>plus</i> wife <i>minus</i>
affection equals&mdash;the Devil!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Audley, with his quiet grave
laugh. "I grant that it is often the misfortune
of a man in your station to be married rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
for what he has, than for what he is; but you
are tolerably penetrating, and not likely to be
deceived in the character of the woman you
court."</p>

<p>"Of the woman I <i>court</i>?&mdash;No! But of the
woman I <i>marry</i>, very likely indeed. Woman is
a changeable thing, as our Virgil informed us at
school; but her change <i>par excellence</i> is from the
fairy you woo to the brownie you wed. It is not
that she has been a hypocrite, it is that she is
a transmigration. You marry a girl for her accomplishments.
She paints charmingly, or plays
like St. Cecilia. Clap a ring on her finger, and
she never draws again&mdash;except perhaps your
caricature on the back of a letter, and never
opens a piano after the honeymoon. You marry
her for her sweet temper; and next year, her
nerves are so shattered that you can't contradict
her but you are whirled into a storm of hysterics.
You marry her because she declares she hates
balls and likes quiet; and ten to one but what
she becomes a patroness at Almacks, or a lady
in waiting."</p>

<p>"Yet most men marry, and most men survive
the operation."</p>

<p>"If it were only necessary to live, that would
be a consolatory and encouraging reflection.
But to live with peace, to live with dignity, to
live with freedom, to live in harmony with your
thoughts, your habits, your aspirations&mdash;and this
in the perpetual companionship of a person to
whom you have given the power to wound your
peace, to assail your dignity, to cripple your
freedom, to jar on each thought and each habit,
and bring you down to the meanest details of
earth, when you invite her, poor soul, to soar to
the spheres&mdash;that makes the to be, or not to be,
which is the question."</p>

<p>"If I were you, Harley, I would do as I have
heard the author of <i>Sandford and Merton</i> did&mdash;choose
out a child and educate her yourself
after your own heart."</p>

<p>"You have hit it," answered Harley, seriously.
"That has long been my idea&mdash;a very
vague one, I confess. But I fear I shall be an
old man before I find even the child."</p>

<p>"Ah," he continued, yet more earnestly,
while the whole character of his varying countenance
changed again&mdash;"ah! if indeed I could
discover what I seek&mdash;one who with the heart
of a child has the mind of a woman; one who
beholds in nature the variety, the charm, the
never feverish, ever healthful excitement that
others vainly seek in the bastard sentimentalities
of a life false with artificial forms; one who
can comprehend, as by intuition, the rich poetry
with which creation is clothed&mdash;poetry so clear
to the child when enraptured with the flower,
or when wondering at the star! If on me such
exquisite companionship were bestowed&mdash;why,
then"&mdash;he paused, sighed deeply, and, covering
his face with his hand, resumed in faltering accents,</p>

<p>"But once&mdash;but once only, did such visions
of the Beautiful made human rise before me&mdash;amidst
'golden exhalations of the dawn.' It
beggared my life in vanishing. You know only&mdash;you only&mdash;how&mdash;how&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bowed his head, and the tears forced
themselves through his clenched fingers.</p>

<p>"So long ago!" said Audley, sharing his
friend's emotion. "Years so long and so weary,
yet still thus tenacious of a mere boyish memory."</p>

<p>"Away with it, then!" cried Harley, springing
to his feet, and with a laugh of strange merriment.
"Your carriage still waits; set me
home before you go to the House."</p>

<p>Then laying his hand lightly on his friend's
shoulder, he said, "Is it for you, Audley Egerton,
to speak sneeringly of boyish memories?
What else is it that binds us together? What
else warms my heart when I meet you? What
else draws your thoughts from blue-books and
beer-bills, to waste them on a vagrant like me?
Shake hands. Oh, friend of my boyhood! recollect
the oars that we plied and the bats that
we wielded in the old time, or the murmured
talk on the moss-grown bank, as we sate together,
building in the summer air castles
mightier than Windsor. Ah! they are strong
ties, those boyish memories, believe me! I remember
as if it were yesterday my translation
of that lovely passage in Persius, beginning&mdash;let
me see&mdash;ah!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quum primum pavido custos mihi purpura cessit,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that passage on friendship which gushes out so
livingly from the stern heart of the satirist.
And when old &mdash;&mdash; complimented me on my
verses, my eye sought yours. Verily, I now
say as then,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nescio quod, certe est quod me tibi temperet astrum."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Audley turned away his head as he returned
the grasp of his friend's hand; and while Harley,
with his light elastic footstep, descended
the stairs, Egerton lingered behind, and there
was no trace of the worldly man upon his countenance
when he took his place in the carriage
by his companion's side.</p>

<p>Two hours afterward, weary cries of "Question,
question!" "Divide, divide!" sank into
reluctant silence as Audley Egerton rose to
conclude the debate&mdash;the man of men to speak
late at night, and to impatient benches: a man
who would be heard; whom a Bedlam broke
loose would not have roared down; with a voice
clear and sound as a bell, and a form as firmly
set on the ground as a church-tower. And
while, on the dullest of dull questions, Audley
Egerton thus, not too lively himself, enforced attention,
where was Harley L'Estrange? Standing
alone by the river at Richmond, and murmuring
low fantastic thoughts as he gazed on
the moonlit tide.</p>

<p>When Audley left him at home, he had joined
his parents, made them gay with his careless
gayety, seen the old-fashioned folks retire to
rest, and then&mdash;while they, perhaps, deemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
him once more the hero of ball-rooms and the
cynosure of clubs&mdash;he drove slowly through
the soft summer night, amidst the perfumes of
many a garden and many a gleaming chestnut
grove, with no other aim before him than to
reach the loveliest margin of England's loveliest
river, at the hour the moon was fullest and
the song of the nightingale most sweet. And
so eccentric a humorist was this man, that I
believe, as be there loitered&mdash;no one near to
cry "How affected!" or "How romantic!"&mdash;he
enjoyed himself more than if he had been exchanging
the politest "how-d'ye-do's" in the
hottest of London drawing-rooms, or betting his
hundreds on the odd trick with Lord De R&mdash;&mdash; for
his partner.</p>

<h2>MARY KINGSFORD.</h2>

<h3>RECOLLECTIONS OF A POLICE-OFFICER.</h3>


<p>Toward the close of the year 1836, I was
hurriedly dispatched to Liverpool for the purpose
of securing the person of one Charles James
Marshall, a collecting clerk, who, it was suddenly
discovered, had absconded with a considerable
sum of money belonging to his employers. I
was too late&mdash;Charles James Marshall having
sailed in one of the American liners the day before
my arrival in the northern commercial capital.
This fact well ascertained, I immediately set out
on my return to London. Winter had come upon
us unusually early; the weather was bitterly
cold; and a piercing wind caused the snow,
which had been falling heavily for several hours,
to gyrate in fierce, blinding eddies, and heaped
it up here and there into large and dangerous
drifts. The obstruction offered by the rapidly-congealing
snow greatly delayed our progress
between Liverpool and Birmingham; and at a
few miles only distant from the latter city, the
leading engine ran off the line. Fortunately, the
rate at which we were traveling was a very slow
one, and no accident of moment occurred. Having
no luggage to care for, I walked on to Birmingham,
where I found the parliamentary train
just on the point of starting, and with some hesitation,
on account of the severity of the weather,
I took my seat in one of the then very much exposed
and uncomfortable carriages. We traveled
steadily and safely, though slowly along, and
reached Rugby Station in the afternoon, where
we were to remain, the guard told us, till a fast
down-train had passed. All of us hurried as quickly
as we could to the large room at this station,
where blazing fires and other appliances soon
thawed the half-frozen bodies, and loosened the
tongues of the numerous and motley passengers.
After recovering the use of my benumbed limbs
and faculties, I had leisure to look around and
survey the miscellaneous assemblage about me.</p>

<p>Two persons had traveled in the same compartment
with me from Birmingham, whose exterior,
as disclosed by the dim light of the railway
carriage, created some surprise that such finely-attired,
fashionable gentlemen should stoop to
journey by the plebeian penny-a-mile train. I
could now observe them in a clearer light, and
surprise at their apparent condescension vanished
at once. To an eye less experienced than mine
in the artifices and expedients familiar to a certain
class of "swells," they might perhaps have
passed muster for what they assumed to be, especially
amidst the varied crowd of a "parliamentary;"
but their copper finery could not for
a moment impose upon me. The watch-chains
were, I saw, mosaic; the watches, so frequently
displayed, gilt; eye-glasses the same; the coats,
fur-collared and cuffed, were ill-fitting and second-hand;
ditto of the varnished boots and renovated
velvet waistcoats; while the luxuriant mustaches
and whiskers, and flowing wigs, were unmistakably
mere <i>pi&egrave;ces d'occasion</i>&mdash;assumed and diversified
at pleasure. They were both apparently
about fifty years of age; one of them perhaps one
or two years less than that. I watched them
narrowly, the more so from their making themselves
ostentatiously attentive to a young woman&mdash;girl
rather she seemed&mdash;of a remarkably graceful
figure, but whose face I had not yet obtained
a glimpse of. They made boisterous way for her
to the fire, and were profuse and noisy in their
offers of refreshment&mdash;all of which, I observed,
were peremptorily declined. She was dressed in
deep, unexpensive mourning; and from her timid
gestures and averted head, whenever either of the
fellows addressed her, was, it was evident, terrified
as well as annoyed by their rude and insolent
notice. I quietly drew near to the side of the
fire-place at which she stood, and with some difficulty
obtained a sight of her features. I was
struck with extreme surprise&mdash;not so much at
her singular beauty, as from an instantaneous
conviction that she was known to me, or at least
that I had seen her frequently before, but where
or when I could not at all call to mind. Again
I looked, and my first impression was confirmed.
At this moment the elder of the two men I have
partially described placed his hand, with a rude
familiarity, upon the girl's shoulder, proffering at
the same time a glass of hot brandy-and-water for
her acceptance. She turned sharply and indignantly
away from the fellow; and looking round
as if for protection, caught my eagerly-fixed gaze.</p>

<p>"Mr. Waters!" she impulsively ejaculated.
"Oh, I am so glad!"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, "that is certainly my
name; but I scarcely remember&mdash;Stand back,
fellow!" I angrily continued, as her tormentor,
emboldened by the spirits he had drunk, pressed
with a jeering grin upon his face, toward her,
still tendering the brandy and water. "Stand
back!" He replied by a curse and a threat.
The next moment his flowing wig was whirling
across the room, and he standing with his bullet-head
bare but for a few locks of iron-gray, in an
attitude of speechless rage and confusion, increased
by the peals of laughter which greeted
his ludicrous, unwigged aspect. He quickly put
himself in a fighting attitude, and, backed by
his companion, challenged me to battle. This
was quite out of the question; and I was somewhat
at a loss how to proceed, when the bell
announcing the instant departure of the train
rang out, my furious antagonist gathered up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
adjusted his wig, and we all sallied forth to take
our places&mdash;the young woman holding fast by
my arm, and in a low, nervous voice, begging
me not to leave her. I watched the two fellows
take their seats, and then led her to the hind-most
carriage, which we had to ourselves as far
as the next station.</p>

<p>"Are Mrs. Waters and Emily quite well?"
said the young woman, coloring, and lowering
her eyes beneath my earnest gaze, which she
seemed for a moment to misinterpret.</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;entirely so," I almost stammered.
"You know us then?"</p>

<p>"Surely I do," she replied, reassured by my
manner. "But you, it seems," she presently
added, with a winning smile, "have quite forgotten
little Mary Kingsford."</p>

<p>"Mary Kingsford!" I exclaimed, almost with
a shout. "Why, so it is! But what a transformation
a few years have effected!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Not <i>pretty</i> Mary Kingsford
now, then, I suppose?" she added, with a
light, pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean, you vain puss you!"
I replied, quite gleefully, for I was overjoyed at
meeting with the gentle, well remembered playmate
of my own eldest girl. We were old familiar
friends&mdash;almost father and daughter&mdash;in
an instant.</p>

<p>Little Mary Kingsford, I should state, was,
when I left Yorkshire, one of the prettiest, most
engaging children I had ever seen; and a petted
favorite not only with us, but of every other family
in the neighborhood. She was the only child
of Philip and Mary Kingsford&mdash;a humble, worthy,
and much respected couple. The father was
gardener to Sir Pyott Dalzell, and her mother
eked out his wages to a respectable maintenance
by keeping a cheap children's school. The change
which a few years had wrought in the beautiful
child was quite sufficient to account for my imperfect
recognition of her; but the instant her
name was mentioned, I at once recognized the
rare comeliness which had charmed us all in her
childhood. The soft brown eyes were the same,
though now revealing profounder depths, and
emitting a more pensive expression; the hair,
though deepened in color, was still golden; her
complexion, lit up as it now was by a sweet
blush, was brilliant as ever; while her child-person
had become matured and developed into
womanly symmetry and grace. The brilliancy
of color vanished from her cheek as I glanced
meaningly at her mourning dress.</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, in a sad, quivering
voice&mdash;"yes, father is gone! It will be six
months come next Thursday that he died!
Mother is well," she continued more cheerfully,
after a pause, "in health, but poorly off; and
I&mdash;and I," she added, with a faint effort at a
smile, "am going to London to seek my fortune!"</p>

<p>"To seek your fortune!"</p>

<p>"Yes; you know my cousin, Sophy Clarke?
In one of her letters, she said she often saw you."</p>

<p>I nodded without speaking. I knew little of
Sophia Clarke, except that she was the somewhat
gay, coquettish shopwoman of a highly
respectable confectioner in the Strand, whom I
shall call by the name of Morris.</p>

<p>"I am to be Sophy's fellow shop-assistant,"
continued Mary Kingsford; "not, of course, at
first at such good wages as she gets. So lucky
for me, is it not, since I must go to service?
And so kind, too, of Sophy, to interest herself
for me!"</p>

<p>"Well, it may be so. But surely I have
heard&mdash;my wife at least has&mdash;that you and
Richard Westlake were engaged?&mdash;Excuse me,
Mary, I was not aware the subject was a painful
or unpleasant one."</p>

<p>"Richard's father," she replied with some
spirit, "has higher views for his son. It is all
off between us now," she added; "and perhaps
it is for the best that it should be so."</p>

<p>I could have rightly interpreted these words
without the aid of the partially-expressed sigh
which followed them. The perilous position of
so attractive, so inexperienced, so guileless a
young creature, amidst the temptations and vanities
of London, so painfully impressed and preoccupied
me, that I scarcely uttered another
word till the rapidly-diminishing rate of the train
announced that we neared a station, after which
it was probable we should have no further opportunity
for private converse.</p>

<p>"Those men&mdash;those fellows at Rugby&mdash;where
did you meet with them?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"About thirty or forty miles below Birmingham,
where they entered the carriage in which
I was seated. At Birmingham I managed to
avoid them."</p>

<p>Little more passed between us till we reached
London. Sophia Clarke received her cousin at
the Euston station, and was profuse of felicitations
and compliments upon her arrival and personal
appearance. After receiving a promise
from Mary Kingsford to call and take tea with
my wife and her old playmate on the following
Sunday, I handed the two young women into a
cab in waiting, and they drove off. I had not
moved away from the spot when a voice a few
paces behind me, which I thought I recognized,
called out, "Quick, coachee, or you'll lose sight
of them!" As I turned quickly round, another
cab drove smartly off, which I followed at a run.
I found, on reaching Lower Seymour-street, that
I was not mistaken as to the owner of the voice,
nor of his purpose. The fellow I had unwigged
at Rugby thrust his body half out of the cab
window, and, pointing to the vehicle which contained
the two girls, called out to the driver "to
mind and make no mistake." The man nodded
intelligence, and lashed his horse into a faster
pace. Nothing that I might do could prevent
the fellows from ascertaining Mary Kingsford's
place of abode; and as that was all that, for the
present at least, need be apprehended, I desisted
from pursuit, and bent my steps homeward.</p>

<p>Mary Kingsford kept her appointment on the
Sunday, and in reply to our questioning, said she
liked her situation very well. Mr. and Mrs. Morris
were exceedingly kind to her; so was Sophia.
"Her cousin," she added in reply to a look which
I could not repress, "was perhaps a little gay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
free of manner, but the best-hearted creature in
the world." The two fellows who had followed
them had, I found, already twice visited the shop;
but their attentions appeared now to be exclusively
directed toward Sophia Clarke, whose vanity
they not a little gratified. The names they gave
were Hartley and Simpson. So entirely guileless
and unsophisticated was the gentle country
maiden, that I saw she scarcely comprehended
the hints and warnings which I threw out. At
parting, however, she made me a serious promise
that she would instantly apply to me should
any difficulty or perplexity overtake her.</p>

<p>I often called in at the confectioner's, and was
gratified to find that Mary's modest propriety of
behavior, in a somewhat difficult position, had
gained her the goodwill of her employers, who invariably
spoke of her with kindness and respect.
Nevertheless, the cark and care of a London life,
with its incessant employment and late hours,
soon, I perceived, began to tell upon her health
and spirits; and it was consequently with a strong
emotion of pleasure I heard from my wife that
she had seen a passage in a letter from Mary's
mother, to the effect that the elder Westlake was
betraying symptoms of yielding to the angry and
passionate expostulations of his only son, relative
to the enforced breaking off of his engagement
with Mary Kingsford. The blush with which she
presented the letter was, I was told, very eloquent.</p>

<p>One evening, on passing Morris's shop, I observed
Hartley and Simpson there. They were
swallowing custards and other confectionary with
much gusto; and, from their new and costly habiliments,
seemed to be in surprisingly good case.
They were smirking and smiling at the cousins
with rude confidence; and Sophia Clarke, I was
grieved to see, repaid their insulting impertinence
by her most elaborate smiles and graces. I passed
on; and presently meeting with a brother-detective,
who, it struck me, might know something
of the two gentlemen, I turned back with him,
and pointed them out. A glance sufficed him.</p>

<p>"Hartley and Simpson you say?" he remarked
after we had walked away to some distance:
"those are only two of their numerous <i>aliases</i>.
I can not, however, say that I am as yet on very
familiar terms with them; but as I am especially
directed to cultivate their acquaintance, there is
no doubt we shall be more intimate with each
other before long. Gamblers, blacklegs, swindlers
I already know them to be; and I would
take odds they are not unfrequently something
more, especially when fortune and the bones run
cross with them." "They appear to be in high
feather just now," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes: they are connected, I suspect, with the
gang who cleaned out young Garslade last week
in Jermyn-street. I'd lay a trifle," added my
friend, as I turned to leave him, "that one or
both of them will wear the Queen's livery, gray
turned up with yellow, before many weeks are
past. Good-by."</p>

<p>About a fortnight after this conversation, I
and my wife paid a visit to Astley's, for the
gratification of our youngsters, who had long
been promised a sight of the equestrian marvels
exhibited at that celebrated amphitheatre. It
was the latter end of February; and when we
came out of the theatre, we found the weather
had changed to dark and sleety, with a sharp,
nipping wind. I had to call at Scotland-yard;
my wife and children consequently proceeded
home in a cab without me; and after assisting
to quell a slight disturbance originating in a gin-palace
close by, I went on my way over Westminster
Bridge. The inclement weather had
cleared the streets and thoroughfares in a surprisingly
short time; so that, excepting myself,
no foot-passenger was visible on the bridge till I
had about half-crossed it, when a female figure,
closely muffled up about the head, and sobbing
bitterly, passed rapidly by on the opposite side.
I turned and gazed after the retreating figure:
it was a youthful, symmetrical one; and after a
few moments' hesitation, I determined to follow
at a distance, and as unobservedly as I could.
On the woman sped, without pause or hesitation,
till she reached Astley's, where I observed her
stop suddenly, and toss her arms in the air with
a gesture of desperation. I quickened my steps,
which she observing, uttered a slight scream, and
darted swiftly off again, moaning and sobbing as
she ran. The slight momentary glimpse I had
obtained of her features beneath the gas-lamp
opposite Astley's, suggested a frightful apprehension,
and I followed at my utmost speed. She
turned at the first cross-street, and I should soon
have overtaken her, but that in darting round
the corner where she disappeared, I ran full butt
against a stout, elderly gentleman, who was hurrying
smartly along out of the weather. What
with the suddenness of the shock and the slipperiness
of the pavement, down we both reeled;
and by the time we had regained our feet, and
growled savagely at each other, the young woman,
whoever she was, had disappeared, and
more than half an hour's eager search after her
proved fruitless. At last I bethought me of
hiding at one corner of Westminster Bridge. I
had watched impatiently for about twenty minutes,
when I observed the object of my pursuit
stealing timidly and furtively toward the bridge
on the opposite side of the way. As she came
nearly abreast of where I stood, I darted forward;
she saw, without recognizing me, and uttering an
exclamation of terror, flew down toward the river,
where a number of pieces of balk and other timber
were fastened together, forming a kind of loose raft.
I followed with desperate haste, for I saw that it
was indeed Mary Kingsford, and loudly called to
her by name to stop. She did not appear to hear
me, and in a few moments the unhappy girl had
gained the end of the timber-raft. One instant she
paused with clasped hands upon the brink, and
in another had thrown herself into the dark and
moaning river. On reaching the spot where she
had disappeared, I could not at first see her, in
consequence of the dark mourning dress she had
on. Presently I caught sight of her, still upborne
by her spread clothes, but already carried
by the swift current beyond my reach. The
only chance was to crawl along a piece of round
timber which projected farther into the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and by the end of which she must pass. This
I effected with some difficulty; and laying myself
out at full length, vainly endeavored, with
outstretched, straining arms, to grasp her dress.
There was nothing left for it but to plunge in
after her. I will confess that I hesitated to do
so. I was encumbered with a heavy dress,
which there was no time to put off, and moreover,
like most inland men, I was but an indifferent
swimmer. My indecision quickly vanished.
The wretched girl, though gradually sinking,
had not yet uttered a cry, or appeared to
struggle; but when the chilling waters reached
her lips, she seemed to suddenly revive to a consciousness
of the horror of her fate: she fought
wildly with the engulphing tide, and shrieked
piteously for help. Before one could count ten,
I had grasped her by the arm, and lifted her head
above the surface of the river. As I did so, I
felt as if suddenly encased and weighed down by
leaden garments, so quickly had my thick clothing
and high boots sucked in the water. Vainly,
thus burdened and impeded, did I endeavor to
regain the raft; the strong tide bore us outward,
and I glared round, in inexpressible dismay, for
some means of extrication from the frightful peril
in which I found myself involved. Happily, right
in the direction the tide was drifting us, a large
barge lay moored by a chain-cable. Eagerly I
seized and twined one arm firmly round it, and
thus partially secure, hallooed with renewed
power for assistance. It soon came: a passer-by
had witnessed the flight of the girl and my
pursuit, and was already hastening with others
to our assistance. A wherry was unmoored:
guided by my voice, they soon reached us; and
but a brief interval elapsed before we were safely
housed in an adjoining tavern.</p>

<p>A change of dress, with which the landlord
kindly supplied me, a blazing fire, and a couple
of glasses of hot brandy and water, soon restored
warmth and vigor to my chilled and
partially-benumbed limbs; but more than two
hours elapsed before Mary, who had swallowed
a good deal of water, was in a condition to be
removed. I had just sent for a cab, when two
police-officers, well known to me, entered the
room with official briskness. Mary screamed,
staggered toward me, and clinging to my arm,
besought me with frantic earnestness to save her.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the meaning of this?" I exclaimed,
addressing one of the police-officers.</p>

<p>"Merely," said he, "that the young woman
that's clinging so tight to you has been committing
an audacious robbery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no!" broke in the terrified girl.</p>

<p>"Oh! of course you'll say so," continued the
officer. "All I know is, that the diamond brooch
was found snugly hid away in her own box.
But come, we have been after you for the last three
hours; so you had better come along at once."</p>

<p>"Save me! save me!" sobbed poor Mary, as
she tightened her grasp upon my arm and looked
with beseeching agony in my face.</p>

<p>"Be comforted," I whispered; "you shall go
home with me. Calm yourself, Miss Kingsford,"
I added in a louder tone: "I no more believe
you have stolen a diamond brooch than that I
have." "Bless you! bless you!" she gasped
in the intervals of her convulsive sobs.</p>

<p>"There is some wretched misapprehension in
this business, I am quite sure," I continued;
"but at all events I shall bail her&mdash;for this
night at least."</p>

<p>"Bail her! That is hardly regular."</p>

<p>"No; but you will tell the superintendent
that Mary Kingsford is in my custody, and that
I answer for her appearance to-morrow."</p>

<p>The men hesitated, but I stood too well at
head-quarters for them to do more than hesitate;
and the cab I had ordered being just then announced,
I passed with Mary out of the room as
quickly as I could, for I feared her senses were
again leaving her. The air revived her somewhat,
and I lifted her into the cab, placing myself
beside her. She appeared to listen in fearful
doubt whether I should be allowed to take
her with me; and it was not till the wheels had
made a score of revolutions that her fears vanished;
then throwing herself upon my neck in
an ecstasy of gratitude, she burst into a flood of
tears, and continued till we reached home sobbing
on my bosom like a broken-hearted child.
She had, I found, been there about ten o'clock
to seek me, and being told that I was gone to
Astley's, had started off to find me there.</p>

<p>Mary still slept, or at least she had not risen,
when I left home the following morning to endeavor
to get at the bottom of the strange accusation
preferred against her. I first saw the
superintendent, who, after hearing what I had
to say, quite approved of all that I had done,
and intrusted the case entirely to my care. I
next saw Mr. and Mrs. Morris and Sophia Clarke,
and then waited upon the prosecutor, a youngish
gentleman of the name of Saville, lodging in Essex
Street, Strand. One or two things I heard necessitated
a visit to other officers of police, incidentally,
as I found, mixed up with the affair.
By the time all this was done, and an effectual
watch had been placed upon Mr. Augustus Saville's
movements, evening had fallen, and I
wended my way homeward, both to obtain a
little rest, and hear Mary Kingsford's version of
the strange story.</p>

<p>The result of my inquiries may be thus briefly
summed up. Ten days before, Sophia Clarke
told her cousin that she had orders for Covent-Garden
Theatre; and as it was not one of their
busy nights, she thought they might obtain leave
to go. Mary expressed her doubt of this, as both
Mr. and Mrs. Morris, who were strict, and somewhat
fanatical Dissenters, disapproved of play-going,
especially for young women. Nevertheless
Sophia asked, informed Mary that the required
permission had been readily accorded, and off they
went in high spirits; Mary especially, who had
never been to a theatre in her life before. When
there, they were joined by Hartley and Simpson,
much to Mary's annoyance and vexation, especially
as she saw that her cousin expected them.
She had, in fact, accepted the orders from them.
At the conclusion of the entertainments, they
all four came out together when suddenly there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
arose a hustling and confusion, accompanied with
loud outcries, and a violent swaying to and fro of
the crowd. The disturbance was, however, soon
quelled; and Mary and her cousin had reached the
outer-door, when two police-officers seized Hartley
and his friend, and insisted upon their going
with them. A scuffle ensued; but other officers
being at hand, the two men were secured, and
carried off. The cousins, terribly frightened, called
a coach, and were very glad to find themselves
safe at home again. And now it came out that
Mr. and Mrs. Morris had been told that they were
going to spend the evening at <i>my</i> house, and had
no idea they were going to the play! Vexed as
Mary was at the deception, she was too kindly-tempered
to refuse to keep her cousin's secret;
especially knowing as she did that the discovery
of the deceit Sophia had practiced would in all
probability be followed by her immediate discharge.
Hartley and his friend swaggered on the
following afternoon into the shop, and whispered to
Sophia that their arrest by the police had arisen
from a strange mistake, for which the most
ample apologies had been offered and accepted.
After this, matters went on as usual, except that
Mary perceived a growing insolence and familiarity
in Hartley's manner toward her. His language
was frequently quite unintelligible, and
once he asked her plainly "if she did not mean
that he should go <i>shares</i> in the prize she had
lately found?" Upon Mary replying that she did
not comprehend him, his look became absolutely
ferocious, and he exclaimed, "Oh, that's your
game, is it? But don't try it on with me, my
good girl, I advise you!" So violent did he become,
that Mr. Morris was attracted by the noise,
and ultimately bundled him, neck and heels, out
of the shop. She had not seen either him or his
companion since.</p>

<p>On the evening of the previous day, a gentleman
whom she never remembered to have seen
before, entered the shop, took a seat, and helped
himself to a tart. She observed that after awhile
he looked at her very earnestly, and, at length,
approaching quite close, said, "You were at Covent-Garden
Theatre last Tuesday evening week."
Mary was struck, as she said, all of a heap, for
both Mr. and Mrs. Morris were in the shop, and
heard the question.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! you mistake," she said, hurriedly,
and feeling at the same time her cheeks
kindle into flame.</p>

<p>"Nay, but you were, though," rejoined the
gentleman. And then, lowering his voice to a
whisper, he said, "And let me advise you, if
you would avoid exposure and condign punishment,
to restore me the diamond brooch you
robbed me of on that evening."</p>

<p>Mary screamed with terror, and a regular scene
ensued. She was obliged to confess she had told
a falsehood in denying she was at the theatre on
the night in question, and Mr. Morris after that
seemed inclined to believe any thing of her. The
gentleman persisted in his charge; but at the
same time vehemently iterating his assurance
that all he wanted was his property; and it was
ultimately decided that Mary's boxes, as well as
her person, should be searched. This was done;
and, to her utter consternation, the brooch was
found concealed, they said, in a black-silk reticule.
Denials, asseverations, were vain. Mr.
Saville identified the brooch, but once more offered
to be content with its restoration. This Mr.
Morris, a just, stern man, would not consent to,
and he went out to summon a police-officer.
Before he returned, Mary, by the advice of both
her cousin and Mrs. Morris, had fled the house,
and hurried, in a state of distraction, to find me,
with what result the reader already knows.</p>

<p>"It is a wretched business," I observed to
my wife, as soon as Mary Kingsford had retired
to rest, at about nine o'clock in the evening.
"Like you, I have no doubt of the poor girl's
perfect innocence; but how to establish it by
satisfactory evidence is another matter. I must
take her to Bow-street the day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Good God, how dreadful! Can nothing be
done? What does the prosecutor say the brooch
is worth?"</p>

<p>"His uncle," he says, "gave a hundred and
twenty guineas for it. But that signifies little;
for were its worth only a hundred and twenty
farthings, compromise is out of the question."</p>

<p>"I did not mean that. Can you show it me?
I am a pretty good judge of the value of jewels."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can see it." I took it out of the
desk in which I had locked it up, and placed it
before her. It was a splendid emerald, encircled
by large brilliants.</p>

<p>My wife twisted and turned it about, holding
it in all sorts of lights, and at last said&mdash;"I do
not believe that either the emerald or the brilliants
are real&mdash;that the brooch is, in fact, worth
twenty shillings intrinsically."</p>

<p>"Do you say so?" I exclaimed as I jumped
up from my chair, for my wife's words gave
color and consistence to a dim and faint suspicion
which had crossed my mind. "Then this
Saville is a manifest liar; and perhaps confederate
with&mdash;But give me my hat; I will
ascertain this point at once."</p>

<p>I hurried to a jeweler's shop, and found that
my wife's opinion was correct; apart from the
workmanship, which was very fine, the brooch
was valueless. Conjectures, suspicions, hopes,
fears, chased each other with bewildering rapidity
through my brain; and in order to collect
and arrange my thoughts, I stepped out of the
whirl of the streets into Dolly's Chop-house, and
decided, over a quiet glass of negus, upon my
plan of operations.</p>

<p>The next morning there appeared at the top
of the second column of the 'Times' an earnest
appeal, worded with careful obscurity, so that
only the person to whom it was addressed should
easily understand it, to the individual who had
lost or been robbed of a false stone and brilliants
at the theatre, to communicate with a certain
person&mdash;whose address I gave&mdash;without delay,
in order to save the reputation, perhaps the life,
of an innocent person.</p>

<p>I was at the address I had given by nine o'clock.
Several hours passed without bringing
any one, and I was beginning to despair, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
a gentleman of the name of Bagshawe was announced:
I fairly leaped for joy, for this was
beyond my hopes.</p>

<p>A gentleman presently entered, of about thirty
years of age, of a distinguished, though somewhat
dissipated aspect.</p>

<p>"This brooch is yours?" said I, exhibiting
it without delay or preface.</p>

<p>"It is; and I am here to know what your
singular advertisement means?"</p>

<p>I briefly explained the situation of affairs.</p>

<p>"The rascals!" he broke in almost before I
had finished; "I will briefly explain it all. A
fellow of the name of Hartley, at least that was
the name he gave, robbed me, I was pretty sure,
of this brooch. I pointed him out to the police,
and he was taken into custody; but nothing
being found upon him, he was discharged."</p>

<p>"Not entirely, Mr. Bagshawe, on that account.
You refused, when arrived at the station-house,
to state what you had been robbed of; and you,
moreover, said, in presence of the culprit, that
you were to embark with your regiment for India
the next day. That regiment, I have ascertained,
did embark, as you said it would."</p>

<p>"True; but I had leave of absence, and shall
take the Overland route. The truth is, that
during the walk to the station-house, I had
leisure to reflect that if I made a formal charge,
it would lead to awkward disclosures. This
brooch is an imitation of one presented to me
by a valued relative. Losses at play&mdash;since,
for this unfortunate young woman's sake, I <i>must</i>
out with it&mdash;obliged me to part with the original;
and I wore this, in order to conceal the
fact from my relative's knowledge."</p>

<p>"This will, sir," I replied, "prove, with a
little management, quite sufficient for all purposes.
You have no objection to accompany
me to the superintendent?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least: only I wish the devil had
the brooch as well as the fellow that stole it."</p>

<p>About half-past five o'clock on the same evening,
the street door was quietly opened by the
landlord of the house in which Mr. Saville lodged,
and I walked into the front-room on the first
floor, where I found the gentleman I sought
languidly reclining on a sofa. He gathered himself
smartly up at my appearance, and looked
keenly in my face. He did not appear to like
what he read there.</p>

<p>"I did not expect to see you to-day," he said
at last.</p>

<p>"No, perhaps not: but I have news for you.
Mr. Bagshawe, the owner of the hundred-and-twenty
guinea brooch your deceased uncle gave
you, did <i>not</i> sail for India, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The wretched cur, before I could conclude, was
on his knees begging for mercy with disgusting
abjectness. I could have spurned the scoundrel
where he crawled.</p>

<p>"Come, sir!" I cried, "let us have no sniveling
or humbug: mercy is not in my power, as
you ought to know. Strive to deserve it. We
want Hartley and Simpson, and can not find
them: you must aid us."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; to be sure I will!" eagerly rejoined
the rascal. "I will go for them at once," he
added, with a kind of hesitating assurance.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! <i>Send</i> for them, you mean. Do
so, and I will wait their arrival."</p>

<p>His note was dispatched by a sure hand; and
meanwhile I arranged the details of the expected
meeting. I, and a friend, whom I momently expected,
would ensconce ourselves behind a large
screen in the room, while Mr. Augustus Saville
would run playfully over the charming plot with
his two friends, so that we might be able to fully
appreciate its merits. Mr. Saville agreed. I rang
the bell, an officer appeared, and we took our
posts in readiness. We had scarcely done so,
when the street-bell rang, and Saville announced
the arrival of his confederates. There was a
twinkle in the fellow's green eyes which I thought
I understood. "Do not try that on, Mr. Augustus
Saville," I quietly remarked; "we are but
two here certainly, but there are half-a-dozen in
waiting below."</p>

<p>No more was said, and in another minute the
friends met. It was a boisterously-jolly meeting,
as far as shaking hands and mutual felicitations
on each other's good looks and health went. Saville
was, I thought, the most obstreperously gay
of all three.</p>

<p>"And yet now I look at you, Saville, closely,"
said Hartley, "you don't look quite the thing.
Have you seen a ghost?"</p>

<p>"No; but this cursed brooch affair worries me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!&mdash;humbug!&mdash;it's all right; we are
all embarked in the same boat. It's a regular
three handed game. I prigged it; Simmy here
whipped it into pretty Mary's reticule, which she,
I suppose, never looked into till the row came;
and <i>you</i> claimed it&mdash;a regular merry-go-round,
ain't it, eh? Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;ha!"</p>

<p>"Quite so, Mr. Hartley," said I, suddenly facing
him, and at the same time stamping on the floor;
"as you say, a delightful merry-go-round; and
here, you perceive," I added, as the officers entered
the room, "are more gentlemen to join in it."</p>

<p>I must not stain the paper with the curses,
imprecations, blasphemies, which for a brief
space resounded through the apartment. The
rascals were safely and separately locked up a
quarter of an hour afterward; and before a
month had passed away, all three were transported.
It is scarcely necessary to remark,
that they believed the brooch to be genuine,
and of great value.</p>

<p>Mary Kingsford did not need to return to her
employ. Westlake the elder withdrew his veto
upon his son's choice, and the wedding was
celebrated in the following May with great rejoicing;
Mary's old playmate officiating as bride-maid,
and I as bride's-father. The still young
couple have now a rather numerous family, and
a home blessed with affection, peace, and competence.
It was some time, however, before
Mary recovered from the shock of her London adventure;
and I am pretty sure that the disagreeable
reminiscences inseparably connected in her
mind with the metropolis will prevent at least
<i>one</i> person from being present at the World's
Great Fair.&mdash;<i>Chambers's Journal.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<h2>Monthly Record of Current Events.</h2>


<h3>POLITICAL AND GENERAL NEWS.</h3>

<h4>UNITED STATES.</h4>

<p>Reports of the same general tendency, although
somewhat vague and contradictory in
details, indicate that plans are on foot to organize
another expedition for a descent upon Cuba. New
Orleans, Savannah, and various places on the coast
of Florida, would appear to be the centres to which
the parties tend. It is supposed that funds to a
large amount have been furnished from Cuba.
The design seems to be to proceed in separate parties
to some point beyond the jurisdiction of the
United States before effecting any formal organization.
The President, under date of April 25, issued
his proclamation, attributing the project mainly to
foreigners, "who have dared to make our shores
the scenes of guilty and hostile preparations against
a friendly power." These expeditions, he says,
can only be regarded as adventures for plunder
and robbery, undertaken in violation alike of the
law of nations and of this country; by the latter of
which they are punishable by fine and imprisonment.
He warns all citizens of the United States
who connect themselves with such expeditions,
that they thereby "forfeit all claims to the protection
of this Government, or any interference on
their behalf, no matter to what extremities they
may be reduced in consequence of their illegal conduct;"
and calls upon every civil and military officer
of the Government to use his efforts for the
arrest of all who thus offend against the laws of
their country.</p>

<p>In New York, information was given to the United
States Marshal that a vessel had been chartered by
persons concerned in the proposed expedition, and
was anchored in the Bay, provided with munitions
of war, and waiting for the arrival of a large number
of men. On searching the harbor, no vessel
answering this description was found, but a steamboat
lying at a pier on the North River fell under
suspicion, and was seized by the United States
authorities. This was the Cleopatra, a large boat,
formerly employed on Long Island Sound, and now
in such a decayed condition as to be nearly unfit
for service, having been built upward of fourteen
years. Nothing was found on board to indicate the
purpose for which she was destined. The forward
hold and boiler room were filled with coal, of which
a large quantity also covered the forward deck.
She had on board a great number of empty water
casks, but no firearms or gunpowder were discovered.
She was placed in charge of a guard of marines
from the Navy Yard, and no communication
was permitted with persons on shore. The final
disposition of the steamer has not yet been determined,
but orders have been given by the Government
to deliver her cargo to any claimant who
could show evidence of proprietorship.</p>

<p>Soon after the seizure of the Cleopatra, the collector
of this port received notice that a vessel engaged
for the transportation of emigrants from South
Amboy to Sandy Hook, was lying at her wharf, in
the former place, under suspicious circumstances.
Officers were immediately dispatched to the spot;
the vessel was seized and ordered to anchor at
Perth Amboy; and intelligence was obtained which
resulted in the arrest of five persons, who were
held to bail in the sum of $3000 each to appear for
examination. These were John L. O'Sullivan, formerly
editor of the <i>Democratic Review</i>, Captain
Lewis, formerly of the steamer Creole, Pedro Sanches,
a Spanish resident of New York, Dr. D.H.
Burnett, and Major Louis Schlesinger of the Hungarian
patriots. The offense with which they were
charged was the violation of the Neutrality Act of
April 20, 1818, in preparing the means for a military
expedition against Cuba.</p>

<p>In consequence of various rumors which prevailed
in the City of Savannah, concerning the invasion
of Cuba, the United States Marshal chartered a
steamboat for an exploring trip to the South. He
proceeded as far as Jacksonville, Florida, and returned
after a cruise of three or four days. Throughout
the whole line of his route, he was met with
accounts of encampments of armed men, but they
proved to be without foundation, and no discoveries,
pointing to any overt acts, were made. It was the
general belief, among all with whom he conversed,
that a movement of importance had been projected
against the island of Cuba, but that from causes
which have not transpired, the organization had
been broken up, and the men connected with it
had entirely dispersed. Between Savannah and
Jacksonville, public opinion was found to be decidedly
favorable to the expedition, the great majority
of the people sympathizing with the Cubans,
and ready to aid them in a struggle for independence.</p>

<p>The session of the Legislature of New York
came to a sudden and unexpected close on the
17th of April, two days after the conclusion of our
last Monthly Record. It being apparent that the
bill for the enlargement of the Erie Canal, which
had already passed the House by a large majority,
would likewise pass the Senate, twelve of the fifteen
Democratic Senators resigned their seats. One
other Senator announced his intention to resign if
the proposed measure were pressed; in which
case there would be only nineteen members remaining;
the Constitution requiring three-fifths of
the whole, or twenty Senators, to form a quorum.
When the bill came up for a third reading, there
were 17 votes in its favor, and 2 against it. No
quorum being present, the bill was laid upon the
table. The Senate thereupon voted to adjourn <i>sine
die</i>; in which resolution the House concurred. On
the same day the Democratic members of the Legislature,
comprising fifteen Senators and forty
Representatives, issued an address to the Democratic
Republican Electors of the State, in justification
of their procedure. They bring severe charges
against their opponents of mal-administration of the
financial affairs of the State; and denounce the
proposed measure as a palpable violation of the
express provisions of the Constitution, and as an
expedient to secure to their opponents the political
supremacy in the State. The Whig members also
issued a long address to the People of the State of
New York, in which they denounce the conduct of
the resigning Senators as a willful violation of the
Constitution which they had sworn to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and as an outrage upon the fundamental principle
of a republican government&mdash;the right of the majority
to rule. They defend the course of adjournment
adopted by the majority, on the ground that two-fifths
of the State was unrepresented in the Senate;
that for various important purposes for which the
assent of two-thirds of the members elected is requisite,
there was virtually no Senate at all; that
it was in the power of a single member of that
body, by a threat of resignation, to dictate upon
any legislative question; and that one member had
threatened, unless the order of business fixed by
the Senate should be laid aside, that he would
vacate his seat, and thus render any legislation impossible.
They proceed to argue at great length
the constitutionality and expediency of the bill.
The Governor has issued his proclamation, convoking
an extra session of the Legislature on the
10th June, and appointing an election to be held
on the 27th of May, to fill the vacancies occasioned
by the resignations of the Senators. Contrary
opinions as to the constitutionality of the bill in
question have been furnished by the ablest counsel.
Among others Mr. <span class="smcap">Chatfield</span>, the Attorney
General of the State, pronounces it to be unconstitutional;
while Mr. <span class="smcap">Webster</span> argues in favor
of the opposite opinion.</p>

<p>The steamer Pacific, which sailed from Liverpool
April 10, accomplished the passage to New
York in 9 days and 20 hours, being the shortest
westerly passage ever made. The greatest distance
run in a single day was 328, the least 302
miles. The shortest westerly passage previously
made was by the same vessel, which was 10 days
4 hours. The shortest similar passage by a Cunarder
was by the Asia, 10 days and 22 hours.</p>

<p>The number of passengers from foreign countries
who arrived at the port of New York within the
four months ending May 1, was above 60,000, being
an increase of more than 30,000 over the arrivals
of last year. During the month of April the arrivals
were 27,779, of which 15,968 were from Ireland,
6372 from Germany, and 2679 from England.</p>

<p>The anniversaries of the principal religious and
benevolent societies were celebrated as usual in
New York in the early part of May. The occasion
drew together a large attendance of persons from
every section of the country. <i>The Seaman's
Friend's Society</i> maintains chaplains in the Sandwich
Islands, South America, California, the West
Indies, France, and Sweden. At the Sailor's Home
in New York, there have been, during the year,
2525 sailor boarders. A single bank has upon deposit,
bearing interest, more than a million of dollars
belonging to seamen. The receipts of the Society
for the year were $20,399 21; the expenditures
$20,446 27.&mdash;<i>The American and Foreign Christian
Union</i> has for its object opposition to Romanism,
by acting upon both Catholics and Protestants
at home and abroad. It has during the past year
employed at home, for greater or less portions of
time, 78 missionaries, of whom the greater number
are foreigners, preaching in seven different languages,
and belonging to almost all the branches
of the Protestant Church. It also employs 30 missionaries
in foreign countries. The Society received
during the year $56,265 20, and expended
$55,169 12.&mdash;<i>The American Tract Society</i> has
issued during the year 886,692 volumes, 7,837,692
publications; of its Almanacs have been circulated
310,000 copies; of the <i>American Messenger</i> 186,000,
and of the <i>German Messenger</i> 18,000 copies are
published monthly. It has employed 569 colporteurs,
of whom 135 are students in colleges and
seminaries. The receipts of the Society exceed
those of any other kindred institution in the country.
For the past year they were $310,728 32, of
which $200,720 33 were the proceeds of the sales of
publications, the remainder being donations. The
expenditures were, for publishing, $179,984 48; for
colportage, $73,278 23; donations to foreign countries,
$20,000; miscellaneous expenses, $37,356 59,
in all, $310,616 30.&mdash;<i>The American Home Missionary
Society</i> has had in its service during the
year 1065 ministers, who have performed an amount
of labor equal to 853 years; these have been employed
in twenty-six States and Territories: in New
England, 311; in the Middle States, 224; in the
Western States and Territories, 515; in the Southern
States, 15. The resources of the Society for the
year were $166,493 94; the liabilities, $163,457 18.&mdash;<i>The
American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society</i>
presented at its anniversary no statistics of its
operations.&mdash;<i>The American Anti-Slavery Society</i>
(known as the Garrison Society), whose meetings
last year were violently interrupted, was unable
to procure a place of meeting in this city. Its anniversary
was accordingly held in Syracuse.&mdash;<i>The
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions</i> have received for nine months of the
current year $186,500, being an increase above the
receipts of last year, of $17,384.&mdash;<i>The</i> ("Old
School") <i>Presbyterian Board of Missions</i> have sent
out during the past year 25 laborers. The operations
of this Board are carried on mainly among the
Indians and Jews of our country, in Western Africa,
Northern India, Siam, China, and Catholic
Europe. The Board has received and expended a
trifle more than $140,000 during the year.&mdash;<i>The
American Bible Society</i> has issued during the year
592,432 Bibles and Testaments, making a total,
since the formation of the Society, of 7,572,967
copies. In addition to new editions of the English
Scriptures, they have issued the Testament in
Swedish and English in parallel columns, and have
in preparation a similar Testament in French and
English. They have also prepared a Spanish Bible,
conformed to the Hebrew and Greek originals. A
translation executed by Rev. Mr. Payne, a missionary
to Western Africa, of the books of Genesis
and Acts into the Grebo language, has been published
at the Society's house. The receipts of the
Society for the year past have been $276,882 52,
which is somewhat less than those of the preceding
year, when they were swelled by unusually large
amounts given by way of legacy.&mdash;The anniversaries
of those noble charities the <i>Institution for
the Deaf and Dumb</i> and the <i>New York Institution
for the Blind</i> were, as usual, of the utmost interest,
and attracted large and delighted audiences.
In the former of these are 247 pupils, of whom 163
are supported by the State, 30 by their friends or
by other States, and 16 are maintained by the Institution.
The Institution for the Blind contains
105 pupils, of whom 52 are males and 53 females;
there are besides connected with it 39 other blind
persons, in various capacities.&mdash;The meetings of
several of the minor associations presented some
interesting features. Among these we specify that
of the New York Colonization Society, at which a
letter was read from Hon. <span class="smcap">Edward Everett</span>, describing
the great benefits conferred by the colonization
of Africa, in introducing civilization, and suppressing
the slave-trade.&mdash;The total receipts of
eleven of the principal religious societies of the
country for the past year were $1,237,875 17, exceeding
those of the preceding year by about $15,000.</p>

<p>The Erie Railroad is now completed, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Hudson River to Dunkirk, 470 miles from New
York. A train having on board the Directors of the
road, went over the whole distance on the 28th and
29th of April. At the commencement of the enterprise,
the State loaned to the road its bonds to the
amount of three millions of dollars. Subsequently,
an act was passed relieving the Company from the
lien imposed by these bonds, on condition that a
single track was completed, and engines passed
over it, from the Hudson to Lake Erie, before the
middle of May. On the day, therefore, in which the
first train passed over the road, the earnings of the
Company were three millions of dollars. The formal
celebration of the opening of the Road took place
on the 14th of May, and was attended by the President
of the United States and a portion of the Cabinet,
as will be seen by a somewhat detailed account
in another page of our Magazine.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, the Hon. <span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>
has at length been elected to the United States
Senate, for the full term of six years. He has taken
no prominent part in politics, but is widely known
as a scholar and philanthropist.&mdash;Soon after the
decision of an exciting Fugitive Slave case in Boston,
a number of citizens who had invited Mr. Webster
to address them on the political condition of the
country, petitioned the Board of Aldermen for the
use of Faneuil Hall on that occasion. A similar
petition having been previously denied to the opponents
of the Fugitive Slave Law, that of the friends
of Mr. Webster was not granted. The Board subsequently
reconsidered their action, and passed a
vote concurring with the Common Council in raising
a joint committee to invite an address from Mr.
Webster, and tendering the use of the Hall for the
purpose. The invitation was not accepted.&mdash;A
violent storm commenced on the 15th of April, and
raged for more than a week along the whole extent
of the Atlantic coast. During the night of the
17th, the light-house on Minot's Ledge, near Cohasset,
was swept away; two assistant keepers who
were in the structure were lost.&mdash;The secret-ballot
law has passed both branches of the Legislature.
It provides that the ballots of voters shall be inclosed
in envelopes previously to being deposited in the
ballot boxes.</p>

<p>In Connecticut there was no choice by the people
of State officers at the late election. Hon. <span class="smcap">Thomas
H. Seymour</span>, the Democratic candidate, has been
re-elected as Governor by the Legislature. The
Democratic candidates for Secretary and Comptroller,
and the Whig candidates for Lieutenant-Governor
and Treasurer, were elected by the Legislature.
In his Message the Governor represents the
finances of the State to be in a prosperous condition;
recommends the passage of general corporation
and banking laws; and of a law limiting the
hours of labor, to contain a provision making it a
misdemeanor to work children under fourteen years
of age more than eight hours a day. He speaks in
favor of the Compromise measures, which he says
must be supported in good faith, or we can not hope
to see this form of Government continue. "Whatever
action then," he adds, "the Legislature may
feel called upon to take, upon any of the questions
to which reference has been made, I feel at liberty
to indulge the hope that its course will be such as
to place the State of Connecticut on patriotic and
dignified ground in the presence of sister States
and the nation, and the world."</p>

<p>A Convention of the Southern Rights Association
assembled at Charleston, May 5. There were between
three and four hundred members in attendance.
Ex-Governor <span class="smcap">J.P. Richardson</span> acted as
President. In his address upon taking the chair,
he said that the question was simply as to the time
and manner of resistance. He spoke strongly of
the want of affinity between the two sections of the
country, and declared that no one should join together
those whom God and nature have put asunder.
A letter from Hon. <span class="smcap">Langdon Cheves</span> was
read, deprecating separate action on the part of
South Carolina, which ought to wait awhile longer
for the action of other States. An address and resolutions
advocating the right and expediency of secession,
were adopted. Mr. <span class="smcap">Rhett</span>, one of the
United States Senators from this State, has developed
what he supposes to be the results of the policy
of secession. Free trade would be proclaimed
with all States south and west of the Potomac, and
a duty of ten per cent. levied upon goods from the
other States and from foreign countries. The result
would be that goods would be twenty per cent.
cheaper in Charleston than in New York. The
trade of Georgia and North Carolina would be carried
on with South Carolina; and it would not be
in the power of the General Government to prevent
it, by a line of custom-houses along the frontier.
He declared the idea of a blockade of the ports
of South Carolina to be ridiculous. Blockade was
war, and Congress alone could declare war; and
Congress must either let them go peaceably out of
the Union or fight; and fight they would in defense
of their rights, liberties, and institutions; and even
if South Carolina should be subdued, the Union was
not preserved; other Southern States would join in
the contest. Should that State secede and remain
for five years an independent State, a Southern
Confederacy must be the result, or the South would
have enforced the guarantees to which she is entitled.
"I have been battling," he says, "in this
cause for twenty-five years, and have now but a
few more years to give to your service. As a citizen
of South Carolina, I demand that she make me
free. My counsel is, secede from the union of these
United States. At every hazard, and to the last
extremity secede. If I was about to draw my last
breath, with that breath I would exhort you to
secede."</p>

<p>In the Virginia Constitutional Convention some
votes have been taken, which afford indications
that the mixed basis proposition in a somewhat
modified form, will prevail. The motion to strike
out the proposition apportioning representation on
the basis of the white population was carried by a
vote of 65 to 56. Four Eastern men, among whom
was Hon. <span class="smcap">Henry A. Wise</span>, voted with the West.
One of the mixed basis propositions failed by a single
vote.</p>

<p>From the mining region of Lake Superior, the
latest intelligence is highly favorable; large quantities
of copper are preparing for market.&mdash;The
President has directed that the lands occupied by
the Hungarian Exiles in Iowa shall not be offered
for sale previous to the meeting of Congress, when
a petition will be presented for the grant of them
to the exiles.&mdash;A riot occurred lately at Milwaukie
upon occasion of a lecture upon Catholicism by Mr.
Leahy, who claims to have once been a Trappist
monk. More than a score of persons were seriously
injured, and considerable damage was done to
the Methodist church in which the lecture was
given. The principal Catholic laity and the clergy
published a card in which they express their unqualified
condemnation of the conduct of the rioters,
and engage to make good the pecuniary injury inflicted.&mdash;The
Central Railroad of Michigan has
for some time been annoyed by a gang, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
at length been brought to light. Their detection
was effected by an agent of the Railroad, who in
order to secure their confidence undertook to set
fire to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t; after, however, taking precautions
to prevent any serious injury. Nearly fifty persons
have been arrested and indicted; among whom are
a judge, justices of the peace, constables, and professional
men. The trial will come on in June.&mdash;The
Legislature of Wisconsin have passed a bill
for the protection of Seventh Day Baptists. It
provides that any civil process issued against a
person who habitually observes the seventh day as
a day of rest, which is made returnable on that day,
may be laid over until the Monday following, as
though that were the return-day of the writ.&mdash;The
small pox is raging with fearful violence among
the Sioux Indians upon the Upper Missouri. It is
also extending down the river, among the Sacs and
Foxes. Several hundred are reported to have already
died.</p>

<p>The Governor of Texas has issued an order for
the arrest of the members of the Boundary Commission
who took part in the recent summary executions
of the desperadoes at Socorro. They are
probably beyond the jurisdiction of Texas. Severe
charges are in circulation against the officers at
the head of the Commission; public opinion will,
however, remain undecided until both sides are
heard.&mdash;The population of New Mexico, according
to the recent census, is 61,574, of whom 850 are
Americans. Of the Mexican population above the
age of twenty, only one in 103 is able to read.&mdash;A
treaty has been concluded with the Apache Chief
Chacon, who binds himself to keep the peace, under
penalty of forfeiting his life.&mdash;An attempt is to be
made to diminish the enormous expense of the military
occupation of New Mexico. Colonel Sumner,
the new commander, will take out with him seed,
grains, stock, and farming utensils, and every effort
will be made to develop the agricultural resources
of the Territory. The head-quarters of the army
will probably be removed from Santa F&eacute; to Los
Vegos.</p>

<p>From California the most striking feature of intelligence
is the unexampled frequency of extra-judicial
punishment for crime. The newspapers
are filled with accounts of summary executions, not
only for murder but for robbery and theft. Under
the peculiar state of things occasioned by the great
temptations to crime, and the utter want of all the
ordinary apparatus of justice, during the earlier
periods of the settlement of California, this was
unavoidable. But instances of this sort, instead of
becoming more unfrequent, seem to be rapidly increasing.
A bill has passed the Legislature, and
become a law, inflicting the punishment of death,
at the discretion of the jury, upon the crime of
grand larceny. This measure was insisted upon
by the mining counties on the ground that, owing
to the unexampled influx of desperadoes and criminals
from all parts of the world, thefts and robberies
had become so frequent, while prisons and places
of detention were so few, that the only possible
punishment was death; and the people had become
so exasperated that the punishment would and
must be inflicted, either by or against the law.
The law imposing a tax upon foreign miners has
been repealed, having been found to work most
disastrously. It drove out of the country many
thousands of the most industrious miners, especially
Mexicans and Chilians, whose labors the State
could ill spare. Indian hostilities have nearly
ceased. A number of the tribes have signified
a willingness to accept of fixed localities, and to
enter into a treaty. The Legislature having granted
to the Governor authority to call out 500 men to
repress Indian hostilities in the Mariposa region,
he made a tour of inspection, and came to the conclusion
that the force was unnecessary. The population
of the State is estimated at 314,000, of
whom about 100,000 are supposed to be engaged in
mining; and the whole amount of gold produced in
the course of last year is estimated at about one
hundred millions of dollars, giving about three and
one-third dollars a day to each individual. It is
anticipated that the amount produced the ensuing
year will not fall short of one hundred and fifty
millions. The recent accounts of the lately discovered
gold bluffs are encouraging, and promise a
large amount of gold from that source. A mine of
quicksilver, stated to be the richest in the world,
has been discovered about twelve miles from San
Jos&eacute;. In the case of a slave brought into the State
by his master, it has been decided that he can not
be removed against his will. A vessel has arrived
at San Francisco having on board seventeen Japanese,
who were picked up at sea from a wreck. It
is supposed that they will be conveyed to their native
country in a government vessel. They are
thought to be the first Japanese who have ever set
foot upon the American continent. A rich coal mine
is stated to have been discovered about eight miles
from Benicia. The quantity of land under cultivation
has greatly increased. Professor <span class="smcap">Forrest
Shepard</span>, of New Haven, has made some remarkable
discoveries of thermal action. In one place,
where there was nothing on the surface to excite
attention, on digging down the heat increased so
rapidly that at the depth of two feet he could not
bear his hand in the earth, and the thermometer
indicated a temperature of 130 degrees. At another
place, after wandering for four days through dense
thickets, he came upon a chasm a thousand feet
deep, through which followed a stream, the banks
of which, on the 8th of February, were covered
with vegetation. Following up the stream, the
earth grew so hot as to burn the feet through the
boots. There was no appearance of lava, and the
rocks were being dissolved by a powerful <i>catalytic</i>
action. From innumerable orifices steam was forced
to the height of two hundred feet. The number of
spouting geysers and boiling springs, on a half mile
square, exceeded two hundred. The Professor, in
the course of a lecture on the mineral resources of
California, delivered in the Senate Chamber at San
Jos&eacute;, said that he did not doubt that silver,
lead, and iron abounded in California.</p>

<h4><a name="Mexico" id="Mexico"></a>SOUTHERN AMERICA.</h4>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Mexico</span> the finances are in a most deplorable
condition. The revenue had fallen to about eight
and a half millions of dollars, while the expenses
exceed twelve millions. The indemnity paid by
our government can afford only temporary relief in
the face of so alarming a deficiency. The Minister
of Finance has resigned his post, and has prepared
a memoir on the condition of the department. The
Government has made a formal complaint against
that of the United States for failure in carrying out
the provisions of the treaty in relation to the suppression
of Indian depredations on the frontier;
and assigns this failure as a ground for refusing to
ratify the Tehuantepec treaty. The Commissioners
of Public Works have been directed to ascertain
the names, employment, and places of nativity of
foreigners residing in the city. Several projects
for a change of government are entertained. One
party are desirous of returning to the dominion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Spain; another is in favor of annexation to the
United States; the return of Santa Anna is desired
by another. The Northern States are still harassed
by Indian depredations. The hostilities in Yucatan
are supposed to be nearly at an end. The municipality
of the capital have petitioned for the suppression
of bull-fights throughout the state.</p>

<p>Hostilities are brooding between Brazil and the
Argentine Republic; but it is hoped that war may
be averted. The dissentions in the latter state are
favorable to the recognition of the claims of Brazil.
Government is endeavoring to suppress the slave-trade,
and its efforts meet with some success.</p>

<p>In Peru the eligibility of Echenique for the Presidency
is disputed, on the ground that he is not a
native of that republic. An especial congress has
been summoned to decide the question, but so violent
is party spirit between his partisans and those
of Vivanco, that apprehensions of a civil war are
entertained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuba</span> is in a state of intense excitement in regard
to the anticipated invasion. The flower of
the Spanish army, to the number, as it is said, of
40,000 men, are concentrated on the island, which
is encircled by the entire disposable naval forces
of Spain. The steamer Georgia, on her late trip,
had the misfortune to run aground at the mouth of
the Mississippi, by which she suffered a considerable
detention. It was reported and believed at
Havana that she was lying off for the purpose of
taking on board the marauding expedition. On the
day of her arrival, a man was executed for having
endeavored to procure pilots for Lopez. He had
been previously subjected to torture, in order to extort
a confession. This is the first public execution
that has taken place for political offenses.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Hayti</span> we have the particulars of a conspiracy
against the Emperor Soulouque, in which
a number of officers of the Government were implicated.
Many arrests and some executions have
taken place in consequence. The attempt of the
American Commissioner and the French and English
Consuls to settle the controversy between the
Haytians and Dominicans, is supposed to have been
unsuccessful. The Government has declined to pay
the claims of certain American merchants to which
our Government has repeatedly called its attention.</p>


<h4>GREAT BRITAIN.</h4>

<p>The event of the month has been the opening of
the Great Exhibition. As if to concentrate attention
upon it, all other affairs of interest have been
withdrawn from the stage. No little surprise and
indignation were aroused by the announcement
made on the 15th of April, that the Queen would
open the Exhibition in person, but that the holders
of tickets and exhibitors would be excluded from
the ceremony. Those who had purchased tickets
for the express purpose of being present at the opening,
were naturally indignant at losing the most
interesting part of the show. The press was unanimous
in condemnation of the contemplated exclusion.
It was denounced as an unworthy insinuation
that the person of the Queen would not be secure
in public; and as giving countenance to certain
absurd rumors of a projected insurrection. The opposition
was so general that the offensive announcement
was withdrawn, and a new programme substituted,
in accordance with which holders of season
tickets were allowed to be present. The rush for
these was so great, that the Commissioners immediately
raised the price another guinea. The Queen
proved a greater attraction than Jenny Lind had
ever been. We can only glance at the opening
ceremonies. Early in the morning the exhibitors
took their places at their stands; and the spectators
came trooping in. At half-past eleven the
Commissioners, foreign and domestic, stationed
themselves in front of a platform of state, under
the arch of the transept. Upon the platform were
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Ministers and
great Officers of State, the Embassadors and Ministers
from foreign Powers, in full dress. At high
noon, the royal cort&egrave;ge entered the Crystal Palace,
the choir upraising the national anthem of "God
save the Queen." Then came addresses to the
Queen from the Commissioners and the foreign
Embassadors, to which the Queen read answers
handed to her by the Secretary of State; then followed
a prayer pronounced by the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and an anthem; a marching in procession
along the nave; a return to the platform, and
the announcement by the Queen that the Exhibition
was opened, proclaimed to the thousands without
by a flourish of trumpets and a royal salute
from the park.</p>

<p>Among the visitors to the Crystal Palace during
the preparations, was the Duke of Wellington.
Once as he entered the French department, the
workmen uncovered two small silver statuettes of
the duke himself and his great rival Napoleon. The
bearded foreigners raised their hats to the conqueror
of Waterloo, who, returning a military salute, passed
on.</p>

<p>The proceedings of Parliament are not wholly
destitute of interest. A motion was offered by Mr.
Disraeli to the effect, that in the re-adjustment of
taxation, due regard should be had to the distressed
condition of the agricultural classes. This was
looked upon as a covert attack upon the principle
of free-trade and upon the Ministers. The Ministers
had a majority of only 13 in a house of 513.&mdash;The
income-tax has been renewed for the third
time, by a vote of 278 to 230.&mdash;Mr. Locke King's
bill for extending the franchise, upon the first reading
of which, in February, the Ministers suffered
the defeat which led to their resignation, came up
for a second reading, April 2. It was lost by an
overwhelming majority&mdash;299 to 83.&mdash;Lord John
Russell introduced a motion that the House should
resolve itself into a committee to consider the mode
of administering the oath of abjuration to persons
professing the Jewish religion. It was a simple
question whether religious belief should disqualify
men for the exercise of civil rights and political
power. The proposed alteration consists merely
in omitting from the oath, when tendered to Jews,
the words, "on the true faith of a Christian." The
motion was vehemently opposed by one or two
ultra members. Sir Robert Inglis took occasion to
remind the House that "the Jews regarded him
whom we regarded as our Redeemer, as a crucified
impostor." Mr. Newdegate thought that the
Pope might well think it safe to adopt the course
he had recently pursued, when he saw the British
Government and one branch of the Legislature
ready to put an end to the last remnant which distinguished
it as a Christian assembly. The motion
prevailed by a vote of 166 to 98. It will pass the
Commons, but be lost in the House of Peers; and
Baron Rothschild be as far as ever from his seat in
Parliament.&mdash;Lord Ashley proposed a bill to encourage
the establishment of lodging-houses for the
laboring classes. It empowers the authorities of
cities and towns to erect buildings for this purpose
and to levy a small tax to defray the cost. When
the sum expended shall have been met by the proceeds
of the rents, the surplus rental, after defraying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
expenses and the cost of repairs, is to be applied in
aid of the poor rates of the place. Startling statistics
are presented, setting forth the condition of the
laboring classes in this respect, and the consequent
disease and immorality.&mdash;The subject of the management
of the colonies excites no small interest.
A most elaborate speech has been made on this
subject in the House of Commons by Sir William
Molesworth. He proposes that all the colonies,
with the exception of those which possess a peculiar
value as military stations, such as Gibraltar and
St. Helena, and the penal colonies, should be made
to pay the expense of their own government and
protection; and that ample powers of self-government
should be given them. The speech, which
discussed all the details of the subject, was listened
to with great attention. Lord John Russell,
in reply, contended that difference in race would
of itself prevent the colonies from profiting by free
constitutions; and if the national troops were withdrawn,
the colonies would fall into hands hostile to
the mother country.</p>

<p>Lord Torrington, whose course as Governor of
Ceylon, had been brought into question in the
Commons, defended himself in the House of Peers
in a labored speech. His conduct in declaring and
enforcing rigid martial law, during a native insurrection,
was defended by Earl Grey, who referred
to the Duke of Wellington as having been obliged,
under similar circumstances, to adopt measures of
great severity. The "Iron Duke" sharply protested
against being brought into comparison, and
denied that he had ever been placed in similar circumstances;
as he had never been suspected of
acting as Lord Torrington was charged with having
done. To govern by martial law was to do so by
the sole authority of the military commander; but
in such circumstances he had always acted on the
principle, that the government should be conducted
in accordance with the laws of the country itself.</p>

<p>The election of Member from Aylesbury, to fill
the vacancy occasioned by the death of the late
Lord Nugent, the biographer of Hampden, has been
declared void, on account of bribery by Mr. Calvert,
the successful candidate. A new election was
ordered.</p>

<p>A dinner has been given to Lord Stanley by a
large number of Members of Parliament, in the
course of which he made a speech which derives
some importance from the great probability that
he will in a few months be placed at the head of
the Government. The gist of the speech was the
assertion of the principle of "moderate duties on
foreign imports, at once to afford a certain check to
the unlimited importation of foreign articles, and
at the same time to obtain from foreigners, in imitation
of all other nations, a contribution toward the
revenue of the State, and enable us to take off
other taxes." This points to a renewal of the corn-laws.
He also criticised the conduct of Government
in relation to the "Papal Aggression," ridiculing
the bill proposed as a "little microscopic measure."</p>

<p>There is rather more trouble than usual in the
Established Church. More secessions to Rome
are announced, some of them being men of rank.
One clergyman falls into an unseemly dispute at
the font with the nurse and parents of an infant
brought for baptism, as to whether the child's cap
shall be removed. Neither will yield, and the
ceremony is left unfinished. Another is suspended
for addressing Cardinal Wiseman as "Your Eminence."
Another will not read the burial service
over the corpse of a dissenter. The vigilant Bishop
of Exeter in a Pastoral Letter charges the Archbishop
of York with a multiplicity of heretical
statements; and summons the clergy of his diocese
to express or refuse their concurrence with him in
a declaration of adherence to the article of the
creed respecting baptism, which, he says, was virtually
denied in the decision of the Gorham case,
and more than hints at secession from the Established
Church. The Archbishops and twenty two
of the Bishops have issued a letter to their clergy,
exhorting them to peace and unity on the subject
of ritual observances, deprecating all innovations,
and recommending them in case of doubt to have
resort to the decision of their bishop.</p>

<p>The general opinion is that the Kaffir war will
be protracted and costly. The savages have committed
the most frightful ravages in the colony. The
Governor has issued a second proclamation, demanding
a levy <i>en masse</i>. He declares that unless
the well-affected and able-bodied men between the
ages of 18 and 25, turn out as before called upon,
the rebellion can not be checked, and if allowed to
extend itself, will be the means of occasioning the
most serious evils. Whenever an action can be
brought about the Kaffirs are invariably worsted;
but these actions are so little decisive, that the
policy pursued by the United States in the case of
the Seminoles in Florida, of ravaging their country,
and destroying the crops, seems likely to be adopted.
The colonists are debating the question whether
they must defray the expenses of the war; they
deny that they are liable, as they had no voice in
the policy which occasioned the outbreak.</p>

<p>The Chartists have issued a new manifesto setting
forth their doctrines and principles. They affirm
that the soil is the inalienable inheritance of all
mankind, and the monopoly of it repugnant to the
laws of God and nature, and its nationalization the
true source of national prosperity. They propose a
scheme by which the state shall gradually assume
possession of the soil, for the purpose of locating upon
it the surplus population. Of taxation and the national
debt they say: "Taxation on industry represses
the production of wealth; on luxuries, encourages
Government in fostering excess; on necessary
commodities, acts injuriously on the people's health
and comfort. All taxes, therefore, ought to be levied
on land and accumulated property." "The National
Debt having been incurred by a class government,
for class purposes, can not be considered as legally
contracted by the people. It is, moreover, absurd
that future generations should be mortgaged to
eternity for the follies or misfortunes of their ancestors,
and the debt be thus repaid several times
over. The National Debt, therefore, ought to be
liquidated by the money now annually paid as interest,
applied as repayment of the capital, until
such payment is completed."</p>

<p>The papers are filled with notices of the great increase
of emigration, especially to America. The
emigrants are uniformly of a better class than those
who have hitherto decided to leave their country.
From Ireland especially, emigration is almost an
epidemic, in the case of those who have any thing
to lose.</p>

<p>A singular instance of legal nicety occurred in a
recent trial of a man charged with threatening to
burn the house and ricks of a neighbor. He wrote,
"Perhaps you may have read of Samson and the
Philistines. If no foxes are to be bought there may
be something instead." In defence it was urged
that in the passage from the Book of Judges referred
to, it is said that Samson "burnt up the shocks
and also the standing corn;" but no allusion was
made to houses or stacks. The prisoner could only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
have intended to do what Samson did. Now it was
no offense under the statute to set fire to standing
corn; and so an acquittal was demanded. The
judge decided that the plea was valid, and directed
the jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal. They
being less perspicacious than the judge, hesitated
for a while, but finally complied.</p>


<h4>FRANCE.</h4>

<p>Affairs continue to present a critical aspect. It is
difficult to see how Bonaparte can be removed from
the Presidency; and still more difficult to see how
he can be continued. The Constitution forbids his
re-election until after an interval of four years from
the expiration of his term. A revisal of the Constitution
can be legally effected only by a Constituant
Assembly called by three-fourths of the
present Legislative Assembly; and a bill summoning
a Constituant Assembly can only pass after
three readings, with three months intervening between
the readings; and then does not go into
effect until two months after the last reading.
Eleven months is therefore the shortest period in
which the alteration can be effected, supposing not
a day were lost in deliberation. In eleven months
the election must take place. Meanwhile a new
Ministry has been formed to take the place of the
avowedly provisional one which has carried on the
government for some months. It is composed as
follows: Foreign Affairs, M. Baroche; Justice, M.
Rouher; Finances, M. Fould; Interior, M. L&eacute;on
Faucher; Commerce and Agriculture, M. Buffet;
Marine, M. Chasseloup-Laubat; Public Instruction,
M. de Crousseillies; War, General Randon; Public
Works, M. Magne. The last two were members
of the Transition Ministry just displaced. MM.
Baroche, Rouher, Fould, and Buffet, belonged to
the Ministry which was broken up by the Assembly
during the Changarnier difficulties. M. L&eacute;on
Faucher was Minister of the Interior for a short
time, in 1849, but resigned in consequence of a vote
of censure from the Assembly. The other two are
new men. What measures this Ministry proposes
nobody is able to say. M. L&eacute;on Faucher, who has
the reputation of firmness and ability and who
seems to be the master spirit of the Ministry,
presented the official programme to the Assembly.
It only stated that the new cabinet would
defend order, would endeavor to unite the fractions
of the majority, and hoped to be able to calm the
public mind, restore confidence, and promote commerce
and manufactures. M. de Saint Beauve,
proposed a vote of want of confidence in the Ministry,
which was lost by 327 to 275, showing a ministerial
majority of 52. A reconciliation between
the President and General Changarnier is thought
to be probable.</p>

<p>Leading political men are endeavoring to secure
the control of a newspaper to advocate their views.
M. Guizot assumes the direction of the <i>Assembl&eacute;e
Nationale</i>, in which he advocates the cause of
Bourbon and Orleans; the fusion of whose interests
is by no means abandoned. Lamartine has added
to his multifarious avocations the editorship in chief
of <i>La Pays</i>, in which he urges a strict adherence
to the Constitution. Cavaignac has attached himself
to <i>La Si&egrave;cle</i>, to uphold Republicanism. The
<i>Constitutionnel</i>, the acknowledged organ of the
Bonapartists, suggests that lists should be opened in
the several departments for consulting the wishes of
the citizens as to an immediate revision of the Constitution;
each citizen to attach to his signature a
simple <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>; and the lists to be verified by the
municipal authorities.</p>

<p>The five departments of which Lyons is the centre,
are the most unquiet of any in the country.
The malcontents are organized into secret societies,
and take occasion of the funerals of any of their confederates
to parade in great numbers. On some
occasions from 10,000 to 20,000 have been present.
The military commandant has forbidden the assemblage
of more than 300 persons at any funeral.
This has called forth a general expression of indignation
from the Republican press.</p>

<p>The students of the University of Paris have made
some demonstrations of sympathy in favor of M.
Michelet. One of their meetings was dispersed by
the police, and a number of the students were arrested
and thrown into prison. The printer and
publisher of the report of a banquet of the French
refugees in London have been sentenced to a fine
of 1000 francs each, and imprisonment for three and
six months. The editor of the <i>Courrier de la Somme</i>
has been tried for publishing an article, expressing
a wish that France, by a signal act of her sovereign
will, "should efface from her brow the lowest stigma,
the name of Republic;" and predicting that
the time would come when the inhabitants would
offer up thanks to God upon the grave of the
Republic. He was acquitted.&mdash;A Society has
been formed in Paris, under the patronage of the
Archbishop, for the purpose of supplying the poor
with bread below the cost price.&mdash;A public dinner
has been given by the Polish refugees to
Dembinski and Chryzanowski, who have recently
arrived, the former from Turkey, the latter from
Italy. Toasts were drank to the Sclavic fraternity
and to the memory of Bem. Warm gratitude was
expressed to the Sultan Abdul Medjid, to whose
firmness it was owing that Dembinski was not
then immured in a dungeon.&mdash;At the celebration
of Holy Week various sacred relics were exposed
to view in the Cathedral of N&ocirc;tre Dame; among
them, if tradition is to be believed, are several
fragments of the true cross, portions of the crown
of thorns, and portions of the nails used at the
crucifixion.&mdash;An engagement took place on the
10th of April at Oued-Sahel, in Algeria, between
the French troops and a body of natives; a number
of the latter were killed, and the remainder put to
flight. The victors set fire to and destroyed the
village of Selloum. The French had eleven men
killed, and thirty-seven wounded.&mdash;The Marquis
of Londonderry, who once made a similar attempt
in favor of Louis Napoleon when a prisoner at Ham,
has addressed a letter to the President to induce
him to use his influence for the liberation of Abd-el-Kader,
or at least to grant him a personal audience.
The ex-prisoner of Ham replies that the captivity
of the Arab chief weighs upon his heart, and that he
is studying the means to effect his liberation. He
would be most happy to see the Emir, but could
only do so to announce good news; and can not
therefore accede to the request for an interview
until that period arrives.</p>


<h4><a name="Germany" id="Germany"></a>GERMANY.</h4>

<p>It seems to be settled, if we may speak with
confidence of any thing in the present state of German
politics, that the old Frankfort Diet is to be
resuscitated. All that has been attempted during
the last three years, is to be set aside. The Frankfort
Parliaments, Erfurt Congresses, and Dresden
Conferences have shown that people and princes are
alike incapable of accomplishing anything; and so
they fall back upon the system formed five-and-thirty
years ago by the Holy Alliance. Prussia, who
not six months ago brought half a million soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
into the field rather than concede to the recognition
of the Diet, is now the first to demand its restoration.
Austria, who was in arms to enforce the decrees
of the Diet, at first coyly hesitated; but by the
latest intelligence, does not seem inclined to oppose
it. It still remains doubtful whether she will persist
in the claim for the incorporation of her Sclavic
and Italian possessions into the German Confederation,
in spite of the remonstrances of England and
France, who maintain that as the German Confederation
was established, and its limits defined by
the Powers of Europe, for the express purpose of
settling the balance of power, the extending of the
limits of the Confederation is properly a European
question. Austria, that seemed two years ago on
the point of dissolution, has gained new vigor, and
presents a front apparently stronger than ever. The
Democratic journals of Europe, however, maintain
that all the appearance of prosperity is unreal; that
discontent is growing deeper and deeper throughout
her vast and heterogeneous population; that
her immense armies are maintained at a cost far
beyond the means of the Empire to defray; and
that national and individual bankruptcy is impending
over her. The minor German States have no
choice but to follow the lead of the two great
powers, and from them we have accounts of petty
quarrels between princes and people, but they are
hardly worth the trouble of chronicling. The German
refugees, in imitation of Mazzini and the Italians,
have issued notes by way of raising a loan;
the name of Kinkel heads the committee.</p>


<h4>SOUTHERN EUROPE.</h4>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Portugal</span> an insurrection has broken out, the
result of which is still undecided. The Marquis of
Saldanha took up arms for the overthrow of the
ministry of the Count of Thomar. His attempt met
at first with so little success, that the marquis was
on the point of abandoning it, and taking refuge in
England. Subsequently, however, the garrison of
Oporto declared in his favor, and he was recalled.
The inhabitants of Oporto likewise declared for the
insurgents.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Spain</span> we hear of Ministerial crises and
changes, dissolution of Cortes, and political movements
of various kinds, all growing out of the impossibility
of making the revenues of the Kingdom
meet the expenditures. A royal decree has been
issued appointing commissioners to examine and
report on the railroads of France, Germany, Belgium,
and England, with a view to the introduction
of similar works in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Italy</span> the States of the Church have been
relieved from one great annoyance by the death of
<i>Il Passatore</i>, the leader of a band half brigands half
revolutionists, who was surprised and shot by the
soldiery. The list of prohibited books has received
a few recent additions, among which are D'Harmonville's
Dictionary of Dates, Whately's Logic,
and Seymour's Pilgrimage to Rome. On the 29th
of March, the young Emperor of Austria reached
Venice, on a tour through his dominions, when he
immediately gave orders, at the instance of Radetsky,
it is said, for the restoration of the freedom
of the port of that city. The 23d of March, the
anniversary of the battle of Novara, so fatal to the
dreams of Italian Unity, has been solemnized in
various parts of Italy under the very eyes of the
Austrians, by chanting the <i>De Profundis</i> and other
funeral ceremonies. Some students have suffered
punishment for taking part in the solemnities.</p>


<h4>THE EAST.</h4>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Turkey</span> a series of insurrectionary movements
has taken place in the wild districts along
the Russian and Austrian frontiers. The latest
intelligence indicates the subjection of the insurgents.
Austria is suspected of complicity in the
outbreak, which has no tendency to render the
Porte more contented with the task of acting as
jailer to the remainder of the Hungarian exiles.
Austria and Russia seem determined to push their
imperial justice to the utmost, and insist that the
refugees shall be detained two years longer; within
which time it is supposed that death must intervene,
to spare any further discussion. The Sultan
is inclined to refuse their demand, and throw himself
upon the protection of France and England.
Severe shocks of an earthquake occurred in various
parts of the empire, from April 28, to March 7. At
Macri, in Anatolia, the upper part of the castle was
thrown down, overwhelming the offices of the Austrian
Lloyd Steam Navigation Company. The
fortifications and houses likewise suffered great
damage. Fissures were opened in the streets
from which poured forth bituminous gases; springs
were stopped up, and new ones opened. A number
of towns are mentioned as having been destroyed.
Livessy, containing some 1500 houses,
was utterly overthrown, not a dwelling being left
standing, and 600 of the inhabitants were buried
under the ruins.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Egypt</span> we learn that a railroad across the
Isthmus of Suez is to be commenced forthwith, apparently
to be constructed mainly by English capital
and engineers. A revolt had broken out in
the district of Senaar. Troops were to be dispatched
from Cairo to the scene of insurrection; but
the efforts of the Pacha were seriously shackled by
the exhausted condition of the country, and the apprehended
difficulties with the Porte.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">India</span>, the frontiers of the Company's possessions
are infested with the incursions of the hill robbers,
who commit their depredations almost within
gun-shot of the British camps. It is difficult to devise
effectual means of dealing with these plunderers.
Regular military operations are altogether
useless, for the robbers will not risk a contest, except
in rare cases. It has been proposed to make
the head man of each village responsible for all outrages
committed within its limits. A number of
railroads are in course of construction in different
parts of the country. A plot has been frustrated in
Nepaul for the destruction of Jung Bahadoor, the
Nepaulese Embassador, who excited so much attention
in England a few months ago; he acted
with most un-Asiatic decision and promptitude in
the suppression of the conspiracy. The Embassador
has refused admittance into Nepaul of a scientific
expedition, having discovered that the entrance
of English travelers and explorers is often followed
in India by the appearance of troops.</p>

<p>Disturbances have recommenced in <span class="smcap">China</span>. The
insurgents were assembled at late dates at a distance
of about sixty miles from Canton, with the
avowed object of overthrowing the present dynasty.
The <i>Friend of China</i> says, "His Imperial Majesty's
continued possession of the throne, is quite a
matter of uncertainty."</p>


<h3>LITERATURE, SCIENCE, ART, PERSONAL MOVEMENTS, ETC.</h3>

<p>The <span class="smcap">President</span> of the United States accompanied
by Secretaries <span class="smcap">Webster</span>, and <span class="smcap">Graham</span>, Attorney-General
<span class="smcap">Crittenden</span>, and Postmaster-General
<span class="smcap">Hall</span>, are at the time when we are obliged
to close our Record for the month, upon a tour to
the North. The main reason of this journey is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
take part in the ceremonies which celebrated the
successful completion of the New York and Erie
Railroad&mdash;the second of those great links which
bind the interior with the seaboard, the great
Lakes and the West with the Atlantic and the
East. They left Washington on the morning of
May 12; the affairs of Government being temporarily
committed to the charge of the Secretaries
of the Interior, of the Treasury, and of War. At
various places on the route they were welcomed
with appropriate ceremonies, and reached Philadelphia
in the afternoon of the same day. Here
Mr. Fillmore briefly addressed the crowd from the
piazza of his hotel; and Mr. Webster, yielding to
repeated calls, made a speech in which he spoke of
the influences that surrounded him in the State where
the Declaration of Independence was pronounced,
and the Constitution framed. The Union which
was then formed, he said, would last until it had
spread from the Pole to the Equator; and notwithstanding
the dangers through which it had passed,
it was now safe. On the morning of the 13th, the
President and Cabinet set out for New York. At
Amboy, they were received by the President and
Directors of the Erie Railroad Company, in whose
name <span class="smcap">Charles M. Leupp</span>, Esq., delivered an appropriate
address welcoming the Chief Magistrate
of the nation, to an examination of the great work
which would so largely develop the resources of the
country, and continue to bind still more closely distant
portions of the Union. Mr. Fillmore, in reply,
spoke of the work on the completion of which he
hoped soon to congratulate his native State, as one
of the most important enterprises in the world.
Passing up the magnificent harbor, the President
and suite were received at Castle Garden as the
guests of the City, by the authorities of New York;
the Mayor in his address alluding to the fact that
this was the first moment that the President had
trod the soil of his native State as the Chief
Magistrate of the nation. From Castle Garden
a procession was formed, passing up Broadway
and down the Bowery to the City Hall, amid the
warmest demonstrations of welcome. The nature
of the occasion deprived the celebration of all partisan
character; the General Committees of the two
great political parties occupied prominent parts of
the procession. At one time there were not less
than a hundred thousand spectators between the
Battery and the Park. On the 14th, in company
with 480 invited guests, among whom were Senator
Fish, Ex-Governor Marcy, and a large number
of the members of the Legislature, the President
and suite left the City by a special train. All along
the route, the utmost enthusiasm was displayed.
At Elmira, where the train arrived at 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, the
night was spent; and the following day they proceeded
to Dunkirk, the terminus of the road, where
extraordinary preparations had been made to celebrate
the event which must result in building a
large and flourishing town upon that spot.</p>

<p>At the annual meeting of the <i>St. George's Society</i>,
the British Embassador, Mr. <span class="smcap">Bulwer</span> was the principal
speaker. In the course of one of his speeches
he alluded to a forgery published in the <i>American
Celt</i>, a paper published at Boston, purporting to be
a copy of an intercepted dispatch from him to his
Government. He used certain expressions which a
portion of the residents of this City, of Celtic origin,
construed into an insult to themselves and their race;
whereupon they held a public meeting, and prepared
a request to be transmitted to the President, asking
him to procure the recall of the offending minister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wm. L. Mackenzie</span>, who took a very prominent
part in the Canadian rebellion of 1837, and subsequently
resided for some years as an exile in this
city, has been elected a member of the Canadian
Parliament, beating the candidate supported by
Government.</p>

<p>The American Association for the Advancement
of Science held during the past month a very interesting
meeting at Cincinnati. Among the papers
read was one upon the "Azoic System of Lake
Superior," by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Foster</span> and <span class="smcap">Whitney</span>,
United States Geologists. This system derives its
name from the entire absence in its structure of organic
remains, and comprises the most ancient of
the strata constituting the crust of the globe. Professor
<span class="smcap">Agassiz</span> characterized these investigations
as conclusive evidence that we had reached the
commencement of animal life, and had a starting-point
from which to proceed. The only event of
higher interest would be the discovery of the skeleton
of the first man. Col. <span class="smcap">Whittlesey</span> presented
two skulls found in a bed of marl in Ohio. They
are characterized by great deficiency in the development
of the intellectual organs. The age of the
skulls is calculated, from indications surrounding
them, at two thousand years; thus establishing the
fact of the peopling of America at a period much
earlier than that usually assigned. Professor
<span class="smcap">Pierce</span> read a paper on "the Constitution of Saturn's
Rings," in which he argued that these were
not solid but liquid; and that no irregularities, or
combination of irregularities, consistent with an
actual ring, would permit a solid ring to be permanently
maintained by the primary planet; and that
a fluid ring could not be retained by the direct action
of its primary. Saturn's rings are maintained
by the constant disturbing force of its satellites;
and no planet can have a ring unless, like Saturn,
it have a sufficient number of properly arranged
satellites. One of the most interesting papers read
was the report of the committee upon Professor <span class="smcap">Mitchel's</span>
system of observing Declinations and Right
Ascensions. The statements of the distinguished
Western Astronomer, made last year at New Haven,
were received with considerable doubt by the
members of the Association. Among the foremost
of the doubters was Professor Pierce, who, at the
solicitation of Mr. Mitchel, was appointed Chairman
of the Investigating Committee. This Committee,
composed of the leading names in astronomical
science, after examining his methods and apparatus,
made a partial report, in which the highest
and most unqualified approbation is bestowed upon
the entire system adopted by Professor Mitchel.
This triumph was honorable alike to the Professor
and his late opponents; and the victor bore his honors
with the modesty appropriate to a lover of science
for its own sake. Professor <span class="smcap">Agassiz</span> read a
paper upon the coral reefs of Florida, embodying
the results of recent investigations made by him, under
the auspices of the United States Coast Survey.</p>

<p>Professor <span class="smcap">Morse</span> has received from the Prussian
Government the "Prussian Gold Medal of Scientific
Merit," as a testimonial for his improvements in
the Magnetic Telegraph. According to the report
of the Prussian commissioner charged with the construction
of telegraphic lines, Morse's telegraph has
been found most efficient for great distances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jenny Lind</span> has returned to New York after a
Southern and Western tour of unexampled success.
So meekly has she borne her honors, that even Envy
would not wish them less. Castle Garden, the scene
of her earliest Transatlantic triumphs, is thronged at
each successive concert by appreciative audiences.</p>

<p>The Gallery of the <span class="smcap">Art-Union</span> is now open. Subscribers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
for the ensuing year will receive a large
engraving from <span class="smcap">Woodville's</span> picture of <i>Mexican
News</i>, and the second part of the <i>Gallery of
American Art</i>, comprising engravings after <span class="smcap">Cropsey's</span>
<i>Harvesting</i>, <span class="smcap">Kensett's</span> <i>Mount Washington</i>,
<span class="smcap">Woodville's</span> <i>Old Seventy-six and Young Forty-eight</i>,
<span class="smcap">Ranney's</span> <i>Marion Crossing the Pedee</i>, and
<span class="smcap">Mount's</span> <i>Bargaining for a Horse</i>. The <i>Bulletin</i>
of the Union, to which members are also entitled,
in addition to much valuable information on matters
relating to art, will contain original etchings and
wood-cuts. The number for April is embellished
with a cut from Cropsey's <i>Temple of the Sibyl</i>,
drawn on wood by C.E. <span class="smcap">D&ouml;pler</span>, to whom we are
indebted for the drawings illustrative of the Novelty
Works in our last Number. It also contains one of
Darley's spirited outlines, illustrative of a scene from
Cooper's Prairie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leutze</span> has nearly completed his second picture
of <i>Washington Crossing the Delaware</i>, the original
of which was destroyed by fire last January. It
has been purchased by Goupil and Vibert, of Paris,
for about $6000. It will be exhibited in Europe
and the United States, and will also be engraved by
Fran&ccedil;ois, who has so admirably rendered some of
the works of Delaroche. The picture in its unfinished
state has been warmly praised by German
critics.</p>

<p>We transfer from the Art-Union <i>Bulletin</i> a notice
of the <i>Game of Chess</i>, a picture of great merit, recently
painted by Woodville in Paris. It has been
purchased by the Union, and is now in its Gallery.
"This is an exquisitely finished cabinet-piece,
which in technical qualities is probably superior to
any thing he has done excepting the <i>Old Captain</i>.
It represents the interior of the sitting-room of a
noble mansion in the days of the Tudors. On the
right rises the immense fire-place, with its frontispiece
of variegated marbles, supported by statues
and richly carved in the style of the Rennaissance.
On the right of this, in the immediate fore-ground,
is a lecturn, upon which rests a book and a lady's
'kerchief. Standing with his back to the fire, before
the chimney, is a portly gentleman&mdash;probably the
father of the family about going forth for a ride, as
he has his cap on his head, wears high boots of buff
leather, with spurs, and an outer-coat of velvet
trimmed with fur. He stands with his hands behind
him in an easy attitude, overlooking a game
of chess which a visitor is playing with the daughter
of the house. The visitor is on the left of the
picture, and sits with his back to the spectator; and
in front is a table which supports the chess-board.
On the other side is the young lady, whose eyes
are fixed upon the game, while the cavalier is lifting
a piece with his hand and looking toward the
father as if for approbation of his move. The mother,
and a page, complete the group. This is a tranquil,
pleasant picture, in which the characters of
the personages are very nicely indicated. It places
the spectator in the very midst of the domestic life
of the times it portrays. It is, however, in the distribution
of light and shadow, and the wonderful fidelity
of its imitations, that the work is most remarkable.
The effect of the light upon the carved
marble is done with wonderful skill, and the representation
of violet, fur, satin, and metals, worthy of
a Micris or a Metzu."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Powers</span>, writing from Florence, thus describes
the statue of California, upon which he is engaged:
"I am now making a statue of 'La Dorado,' or
California, an Indian figure surrounded with pearls
and precious stones. A kirtle surrounds her waist,
and falls with a feather fringe down to just above
the knees. The kirtle is ornamented with Indian
embroidery, with tracings of gold, and her sandals
are tied with golden strings. At her side stands
an inverted cornucopia, from which is issuing at her
feet lumps and grains of native gold, to which she
points with her left hand, which holds the divining
rod. With her right hand she conceals behind her
a cluster of thorns. She stands in an undecided
posture&mdash;making it doubtful whether she intends to
advance or retire&mdash;while her expression is mystical.
The gold about her figure must be represented, of
course, by the color as well as the form. She is to
be the Genius of California."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whitney</span>, the projector of the railroad to the
Pacific is now in London to urge upon Government
to undertake the construction of the road through
the British possessions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gilbert</span>, Member of Congress from California,
himself a printer, has presented to the
Typographical Society of New York a double number
of the <i>Alta California</i> newspaper, printed
upon white satin in letters of gold.</p>

<p>The <i>Philadelphia Art Union</i> has contracted for
an original painting by Rothermel, which is to be
engraved for distribution to its subscribers the
present year. It has likewise provided a portfolio
of sketches from which subjects for commissions
may be selected. The plan of this Association
differs from that of the Art Union of this city, in
that it distributes prizes, not pictures, allowing
those who draw the prizes to select their own
subjects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chilly McIntosh</span>, head war-chief of the Choctaw
nation, has been ordained as a clergyman, and
is now preaching in connection with the Baptist
Board.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Lyell</span> has delivered a Lecture before
the Royal Institution on Impressions of Rain
drops in Ancient and Modern Strata. These impressions
were first observed in 1828, by Dr. Buckland.
A close analogy was discovered between
the impressions on the rocks, and those made by
showers of rain upon soft mud. In conclusion, the
lecturer remarked on the important inferences deducible
from the discovery of rain-prints in rocks
of remote antiquity. They confirm the ideas entertained
of the humid climate of the carboniferous
period, the forests of which we know were continuous
over areas several miles in diameter. The
average dimensions of the drops indicate showers
of ordinary force, and show that the atmosphere
corresponded in density, as well as in the varying
temperature of its different currents, with that
which now invests the globe. The triassic hail
(indicated by indentations deeper than those made
by rain-drops) implies that some regions of the atmosphere
were at this period intensely cold; and,
coupled with footprints, worm-tracks, and casts of
cracks formed by the drying of mud, which were
often found upon the same slabs, these impressions
of rain clearly point to the existence of sea-beaches
where tides rose and fell, and therefore lead us to
presume the joint influence of the moon and the
sun. Hence we are lead on to infer that at this
ancient era, the earth with its attendant satellite
was revolving as now around the sun, as the centre
of our system, which probably belonged then as
now to one of those countless clusters of stars with
which space is filled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Chapman</span>, Manager of the Peninsular Railway
Company in India, has published a pamphlet
on the supply of cotton which India may be made
to furnish, in which he undertakes to show, that
cotton of a quality which can be used for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
fourths of the manufactures of England, such as is
worth there from three to five pence a pound, can
be produced in any required quantity for from one
and one-fourth to one and three-fourths of a penny
per pound. He says it is the difficulty of transportation
which prevents the extensive culture of
cotton in India.</p>

<p>M. <span class="smcap">Eoelmen</span>, the director of the National Porcelain
Manufactory of S&egrave;vres, has succeeded in
producing crystalized minerals, resembling very
closely those produced by nature&mdash;chiefly precious
and rare stones employed by jewelers. To obtain
this result, he has dissolved, in boric acid, alum,
zinc, magnesia, oxydes of iron, and chrome, and
then subjecting the solution to evaporation during
three days, has obtained crystals of a mineral substance,
equaling in hardness, and in beauty, and
clearness of color, the natural stones. With chrome
M. Eoelmen has made most brilliant rubies, from
two to three millimetres in length, and about as
thick as a grain of corn. If rubies can be artificially
made, secrets which the old alchymists pursued
can not be far off.</p>


<h4>OBITUARIES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip Hone</span> for many years an eminent merchant
and prominent citizen of New York, died
May 8, in the 71st year of his age. Having at an
unusually early period accumulated what he regarded
as a competent fortune, he withdrew from
the distinguished mercantile house of which he was
one of the founders, and devoted his time and means
to intellectual pursuits, dignified and generous hospitality,
and the promotion of all enterprises designed
to benefit and honor the city, of which he
was proud to be a citizen. Possessed of a warm
and social disposition, a ready wit, great intelligence,
and no ordinary acquirements he gathered
around him a fine library and beautiful works of
art, without ever withdrawing his interest from
public affairs. In 1825-6 he was chosen mayor of
New York, and discharged the duties of that post
with a decision, energy, and promptitude which
have rarely been equaled. But his most useful
services to the community were in connection with
various associations formed for the public good. He
was president of the first Bank for Savings, and
one of the original Board of Trustees, of which
there are now only three surviving members; and
one of the earliest and most efficient friends of the
Mercantile Library Association. A marble bust of
him, which adorns the library of that noble institution,
sculptured at the request of the members, testifies
to their appreciation of his character and services.
Some few years since his fortune was considerably
impaired by pecuniary reverses, which
befell a near relative; and, although Mr. Hone was
not legally responsible for his obligations, his high
sense of mercantile honor impelled him to discharge
them in full. At the accession of General Taylor,
Mr. Hone was appointed Naval Officer of the port
of New York, which office he held at the time
when, beloved, prized, and honored by all who
knew him, having honorably maintained through
life the character of an high-minded American merchant,
he sank to rest calmly and in full possession
of his faculties.</p>

<p>Commodore <span class="smcap">James Barron</span>, Senior Officer in the
United States Navy, died at Norfolk, Virginia,
April 21, at the age of 83 years. He commenced
his naval career under the auspices of his father,
who commanded the naval forces of the Commonwealth
of Virginia during the Revolutionary War.
In 1798 young Barron entered the navy of the
United States, with the rank of lieutenant, and
served in the brief war with France. In the year
following he received his commission of captain,
and was ordered to the Mediterranean. In 1807,
going out as commander of the Mediterranean
squadron, he was on board the frigate Chesapeake,
when she was treacherously attacked, in a time of
profound peace, in our own waters, by a British
vessel of superior force. He was acquitted by a
court martial, from all blame in the affair. His
subsequent services were rendered on shore, mostly
at Philadelphia and Norfolk. He early acquired
the reputation of one of the most accomplished and
efficient officers in the service. He originated the
first code of signals introduced into the American
navy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David Daggett</span>, LL.D., late Chief Justice of
Connecticut, died April 12, aged 86 years. He
was born in Attleboro, Mass., on the last day of the
year, 1764. After graduating at Yale College, he
studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1786.
In 1791 he was elected to the House of Representatives
of the State, of which he was chosen Speaker
in 1794, at the early age of 29. He continued a
member of one of the Legislative Houses almost
constantly till 1813, when he was elected to the
Senate of the United States. In 1824 he was chosen
Kent Professor of Law in Yale College, which
post he continued to occupy until the infirmities of
age compelled him to resign. In 1826 he was appointed
Associate Judge of the Superior Court of
the State by a Legislature, a majority of whom
were opposed to him in politics. Six years after
he was made Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
This office he held until December, 1834, when,
having reached the age of 70 years, he vacated it
in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
Thus for forty years, from the close of his
26th to the completion of his 70th year, was Mr.
Daggett almost continually engaged in public service.</p>

<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">William Steele</span> died at Big Flats, Steuben
County, N.Y., on the 4th of April. He was
born at New York in 1762, and was actively engaged
during the closing years of the Revolution.
In 1780 he was on board the gun-ship Aurora, which
was captured by the British brig Iris, bearing the
news of the surrender of Charleston to the British.
On this occasion he was severely wounded, and
detained a prisoner of war for some months. In
1785 he was appointed clerk in the Treasury Board.
In 1794 he commanded a troop of horse which took
part in the suppression of the Pennsylvania Insurrection.
He resided in New Jersey till 1819, when
he removed to the western part of the State of
New York.</p>

<p>Gen. <span class="smcap">Hugh Brady</span>, one of the oldest officers in
the army of the United States, was killed at Detroit
by a fall from his carriage, at the age of 80 years.
He was born in Northumberland County, Penn., and
entered the army in 1792, as an ensign. In 1812
he was appointed Colonel of the 22d Infantry. At
battle of Chippewa his regiment was almost annihilated
and he himself severely wounded. He received
the rank of brevet Brigadier-General in
1822. During the disturbances in Canada he did much
to preserve the peace of the frontier. A few years
ago his native State presented him with a
splendid sword, as an acknowledgment of his character
and services.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

W.H. <span class="smcap">Gillespie</span>, of Union College, of that portion
of <span class="smcap">Comte's</span> "Course of Positive Philosophy" which
treats of the theory of the higher Mathematics.
The treatise, in the original, forms about two-thirds
of the first volume of his great work, the whole of
which extends to six large octavo volumes, of six or
seven hundred pages each. The magnitude of this
work is alone sufficient to account for the slow progress
which it has made among American mathematical
students, to many of whom it is probably known
only by name. In the present form, it is made accessible
to every reader. Its publication will constitute
a new epoch in the mathematical culture of
this country, as the original has done in the development
of European science. The opinion of its merits,
expressed by the translator, is by no means
extravagant. "Clearness and depth, comprehensiveness
and precision have never, perhaps, been
so remarkably united as in Auguste Comte. He
views his subject from an elevation which gives to
each part of the complex whole its true position
and value, while his telescopic glance loses none
of the needful details, and not only itself pierces to
the heart of the matter, but converts its opaqueness
into such transparent crystal, that other eyes
are enabled to see as deeply into it as his own."
The opinion of the translator is supported by the
emphatic testimonials of several competent English
authorities. Mill, in his "Logic," calls the
work of M. Comte, "by far the greatest yet produced
on the Philosophy of the Sciences," and adds, "of
this admirable work, one of the most admirable
portions is that in which he may truly be said to
have created the Philosophy of the higher Mathematics."
Moreil, in his "Speculative Philosophy
of Europe," remarks that, "the classification given
of the sciences at large, and their regular order of
development is unquestionably a master-piece of
scientific thinking, as simple as it is comprehensive."
Lewes, in his "Biographical History of
Philosophy," speaks of Comte as "the Bacon of
the Nineteenth Century," and adds, "I unhesitatingly
record my conviction that this is the greatest
work of our age."</p>

<p>With his remarkable profoundness and lucidity
of thought, M. Comte does not combine a mastery
of language in equal proportion. His style is never
flowing, and often harsh and complicated. It is
difficult to render his peculiar phraseology in an
adequate translation. Prof. Gillespie has evidently
performed his task with conscientious diligence,
and has succeeded as well as the nature of the case
permits, in doing justice to his author. He has
conferred an important benefit on the cause of science
by the reproduction of this great master-piece
of philosophical discussion, and will, no doubt, receive
a grateful appreciation from his scientific
countrymen.</p>

<p>Charles Scribner has published an original <i>Life
of Algernon Sidney</i>, by G. <span class="smcap">Van Santvoord</span>, including
copious sketches of several of the distinguished
republicans who were his fellow-laborers in the
cause of political freedom. Among the biographical
portraits introduced by the author, are those of
Cromwell, Milton, Sir Henry Vane, Bradshaw,
Marten, Scot, and others. They are drawn with
considerable spirit, and evident historical fidelity.
The character of Sidney is described in terms of
warm appreciation, though the partialities of the
author have not clouded the fairness of his judgment.
Devoted with enthusiastic admiration to
the memory of the English martyrs for freedom, in
the investigation of their history, he has not neglected
the sound principles of critical research.
His volume hears internal marks of authenticity;
its opinions are expressed with discretion and
gravity; its tone partakes of the dignity of its subject;
and its style, though not sparkling with the
adornments of rhetoric, is sincere and forcible, and
presents occasional specimens of chaste beauty.</p>

<p>The first American edition of <i>The Journal and
Letters of the Rev. Henry Martyn</i>, edited by Rev.
S. <span class="smcap">Wilberforce</span>, has been published by M.W.
Dodd, containing a variety of interesting matter,
which now appears for the first time in this country.
The original English edition is reduced by
the omission of certain portions, which seemed to
be of less value to the general reader, but no change
has been made in the passages retained, which are
a faithful transcript of the language which fell from
the pen of the author. They were written in moments
of intimate self-communion, or in the freedom
of familiar correspondence, revealing the hidden
experience of the heart, with the most child-like
simplicity; while every expression betrays
the intensity of humiliation and the yearnings after
holiness, which were so deeply inwrought into the
character of the distinguished missionary. With
an acute and cultivated intellect, which enabled
him to bear away the highest University honors,
Henry Martyn combined a fervor of devotion, an
unworldly forgetfulness of self, and a passion for the
spiritual welfare of his fellow-men, which in another
age would not have failed to win him the canonization
of a saint. The transparent confessions of such
a man, describing the struggles and triumphs of the
interior life, must be welcomed by every religious
reader. Nor are they less valuable as an illustration
of the workings of human nature, when under
the influence of the strong emotions engendered by
the austere and sublime faith with which the subject
identified his conceptions of Christianity. The
American editor appropriately commends the work
to young men in our colleges and seminaries of
learning, with the remark that "Martyn was a
scholar of varied and profound attainments, but he
counted it his highest honor to lay his laurels at his
Saviour's feet, and could all the young men in our
colleges go forth in his spirit, the strongholds of
error and sin would be speedily shaken."</p>

<p><i>The Water Witch</i> forms the last volume of J.
<span class="smcap">Fenimore Cooper's</span> Collective Works, in Geo. P.
Putnam's tasteful and convenient edition. The
opinion of the author on the comparative merits of
this novel is briefly stated in the Preface. "The
book has proved a comparative failure. The facts
of this country are all so recent and so familiar, that
every innovation on them, by means of the imagination
is coldly received, if it be not absolutely
frowned upon. Nevertheless this is probably the
most imaginative book ever written by the author.
Its fault is in blending too much of the
real with the purely ideal. Halfway measures
will not do in matters of this sort; and it is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
safer to preserve the identity of a book by a fixed
and determinate character, than to make the effort
to steer between the true and the false." In another
passage, Mr. Cooper gives utterance to the
fears which haunt his imagination, in regard to the
innovating tendencies of the present day. "As for
the Patroons of Kinderbook, the genus seems about
to expire among us. Not only are we to have no
more patroons, but the decree has gone forth from
the virtuous and infallible voters that there are to
be no more estates.</p>

<blockquote><p>'All the realm shall be in common, and in Cheapside
shall my palfrey go to grass.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The collected wisdom of the State has decided that
it is true policy to prevent the affluent from converting
their money into land. The curse of mediocrity
weighs upon us, and its blunders can be repaired
only through the hard lessons of experience."
Mr. Cooper alludes to the great number of typographical
errors which are found in the former
editions of this work. It was written in Italy and
first printed in Germany. The American compositor,
conceiving that he had a right to correct the
blunders of a foreigner, took the law into his own
hands, and exercised a sovereign power over the
author's orthography. He has endeavored to do
himself justice in this particular, and accordingly
claims a greater degree of improvement for the
Water Witch in the present edition, than for any
other work which has passed through his hands.</p>

<p>The serial publication of <i>London Labor</i>, by <span class="smcap">Henry
Mayhew</span>, from the press of Harper and Brothers,
has reached its fifth number, and thus far, we discover
no diminution of interest in its contents. Mr.
Mayhew has plunged into the thick of what he appropriately
styles the nomadic life of London, and
brings up its startling revelations to the light of
day, without the slightest disguise or embellishment.
His work contains the stuff for many novels
of real life, which, in the hands of a master, would
rival the creations of Dickens or Thackeray. Some
of the most interesting scenes, which he describes,
are related in the words of the parties concerned,
with whom the author appears to have had a perfectly
good understanding. As a contribution to
the history of social development in the nineteenth
century, we regard this work as one of the most
important of the day.</p>

<p><i>The Fruit Garden</i>, by <span class="smcap">P. Barry</span> (published by
Charles Scribner), is a practical treatise on the cultivation
of fruit-trees, with over one hundred and
fifty illustrations, representing the different parts
of trees, all practical operations, designs for plantations,
and other important points in this branch of
arboriculture. The extent and variety of information
which it presents, with the clearness of its
practical directions, and its adaptation to American
cultivation, will make it a standard work of reference
with intelligent fruit growers.</p>

<p><i>The Female Jesuit</i> (published by M.W. Dodd),
is the title of a narrative, purporting to be the history
of a religious impostor, who, after a complicated
career of intrigue and duplicity in England, was
at length detected in her plots, although no light is
thrown on their origin and purposes. The work is
issued with the conviction on the part of the English
editors, that she was the agent of some great
system in the Catholic interest, that may have been
brought into action far more widely than Protestants
are aware. In the absence of positive proof,
they hesitate to charge her deception on the Jesuits,
but they are evidently of opinion that the suspicion
is warranted by the facts in the case. The volume,
it must be confessed has too much the air of a romance
to command implicit reliance. We should
have greater confidence in it as a history, if it did
not show such a studious concealment of responsible
names, with the omission of other circumstances
that are essential to authentic investigation.</p>

<p><i>The Wife's Sister; or, The Forbidden Marriage</i>
is the title of a novel by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hubback</span>,
niece of Miss Austen (published by Harper and
Brothers), written with more than common graphic
power, and unfolding a plot of great intensity of
passion. It was written previously to the great
agitation on the question of the Law of Marriage
in England, and was published without reference
to that much debated subject, although it presents
a vivid illustration of the possible effects of the
enactment alluded to, both in its social and personal
bearings. Apart from these considerations, however,
it is a story of remarkable interest, and is
well worth perusal by all who have an appetite
for a good novel.</p>

<p>A new volume of <i>Poems</i>, by Mrs. <span class="smcap">E.H. Evans</span>,
has been published by Lippincott, Grambo, and Co.,
with an Introduction by her brother, the distinguished
pulpit orator, Rev. T.H. Stockton. The
volume consists principally of effusions marked by
a strong religious spirit, and a vein of modest and
tender domestic sentiment. Many of them indicate
a true poetic imagination, but without sufficient
affluence or aptness of diction to do it justice in
expression.</p>

<p><i>Dealings with the Inquisition</i>, by Dr. <span class="smcap">Giacinto
Achilli</span> (published by Harper and Brothers), is a
work that has attracted great attention in England,
on account of its relation to the Roman Catholic
controversy, and for the same reason, will find
many readers in this country. Falling under the
suspicion of heresy, the author was subjected to
the power of the Inquisition, which, though kept
in the back-ground, appears, from his statements, to
have lost none of its vitality with the lapse of ages.
His book is full of curious disclosures, which are
apparently sustained by competent authority.</p>

<p>Geo. P. Putnam has issued <i>A Treatise on Political
Economy</i>, by <span class="smcap">George Opdyke</span>, in which the
author undertakes to present a system in perfect
harmony with the other portions of our political
edifice&mdash;a system grounded on the broad principles
of justice and equality, and in all its doctrines and
legislative applications solely designed to illustrate
and enforce those principles. Maintaining the policy
of freedom in its broadest sense&mdash;freedom of
industry, freedom of trade, and freedom of political
institutions, the volume has been especially prompted
by the desire of the author to disseminate his
peculiar views on the subject of Money. He claims
to have discovered a plan for furnishing a paper
currency, which, although irredeemable, and therefore
free from the cost of production, he believes
will perform the offices of money much better than
either bank-notes or coin. He sustains his theories
with considerable force of argument, and in a lucid
and compact style; but he has not succeeded in
freeing them from difficulties, which must embarrass
their reception by cautious thinkers on the
complicated science to which his work is devoted.</p>

<p><i>Harper's New York and Erie Railroad Guide</i>,
by <span class="smcap">William Macleod</span>, is a seasonable publication,
which will form an indispensable appendage
to the preparations of the pleasure-hunter, who is
about to view, for the first time, the magnificent
scenery on this great public avenue. It contains
nearly a hundred and fifty engravings, from original
sketches made expressly for the work, and executed
in the usual admirable style of Lossing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Barritt. The letter-press descriptions are written
in a lively and pleasing style, and furnish a great
amount of geographical and local information, with
regard to the interior of the Empire State. Every
traveler on this route, which is destined to be the
favorite choice of the lover of the grand and imposing
in American scenery, no less than of the hurried
business-man with whom time is money, will find
the enjoyment of his tour greatly enhanced by the
cheerful and instructive companionship of this agreeable
volume.</p>

<p>Lindsay and Blakiston have published a second
series of <i>Characteristics of Literature</i>, by <span class="smcap">Henry
T. Tuckerman</span>, containing essays on Manzoni,
Steele, Humboldt, Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;, Horne
Tooke, Wilson, Talfourd, Beckford, Hazlitt, Everett,
and Godwin. They are written in the style
of polished elegance and graceful facility which has
given the author such a high reputation with most
cultivated readers. Free from extravagance of
conception or diction, pervaded with a tone of natural
and manly feeling, and thoroughly imbued with
the spirit of the best literary productions, they
claim a favorable reception from the public on the
ground of their purity of taste, their refinement of
expression, and their genial and appreciative principles
of criticism. The essays on Humboldt and
Horne Tooke, in particular, are, in a high degree,
original and suggestive, and present a very favorable
specimen of a kind of discussion in which the
author excels.</p>

<p><i>The Gold-Worshipers</i> (published by Harper and
Brothers), is the title of a brilliant satirical novel
illustrating the mania for speculation, and the extravagance
of fashionable life, which have recently
exhibited such remarkable developments in the
highest English society. The characters are drawn
with amusing life-likeness, and must have been
copied from well-known originals. A more spirited
and sparkling commentary on the times has not
been issued by the London press.</p>

<p>Robert Carter and Brothers have issued a new
volume by Mrs. <span class="smcap">L.H. Sigourney</span>, entitled <i>Letters to
my Pupils</i>, comprising a selection from her correspondence
with the young ladies of her different
classes, during their course of instruction at her
private seminary in Connecticut. They are filled
with valuable counsels, marked with the good
sense, affectionate feeling, and practical tendency
which are conspicuous features of the author's
mind. In addition to the letters, the volume contains
some pleasing reminiscences of Mrs. Sigourney's
experience as a teacher, with sketches of the
character and personal history of several of her
more distinguished pupils, now deceased. The
work will be found to offer a variety of attractive
and useful matter for family reading.</p>

<p><i>Maurice Tiernay</i>, by <span class="smcap">Charles Lever</span>, has been
issued by Harper and Brothers in their Library of
Select Novels. The readers of this Magazine will
no doubt welcome in a permanent shape this favorite
story, which has formed such an agreeable feature
in our pages.</p>

<p>Charles Scribner has published a new volume
by <span class="smcap">N.P. Willis</span>, with the characteristic title of
<i>Hurry-Graphs</i>, containing sketches of scenery,
celebrities, and society, taken from life. It is
marked with the nice, microscopic observation of
character and manners which, in the department
of natural science, would make the fortune of an
entomologist, and which, as employed by the author,
has given him an unrivaled reputation as the
delineator of the minutest phases of society. The
verbal felicity of his expositions is no less remarkable
than the subtlety of his insight, and so gracefully
does he trample on the received usages of
language, that the most obstinate adherent to the
dictionary can not grudge him the words, which he
combines in such bright and fanciful forms in his
unlicensed kaleidoscope. In the present volume,
which is filled with all sorts of enticements, we
prefer the descriptions of nature to the sketches
of character. Even the dusty road-side grows delightful
under the touches of Willis's blossom-dropping
pen, and when we come to the mountain and
lake, it is like reveling in all the fragrant odors of
Paradise. Here the author feels genially at home,
and abandons himself to the natural, joyous, unreflective
impulses of the scene; while, in his portraitures
of character, which are usually more elaborate,
he betrays the consciousness of an obligation
to say something, which, if not original, shall at
least astonish the reader with its appearance of
novelty. His judgments, however, are often strikingly
acute, and show his ready perception of individual
life, no less than of the motley aspects of
society. In this work they are singularly free
from any tincture of bitterness, the result of a
catholic appreciation of character, rather than of
any milky sweetness of temperament.</p>

<p><i>Eastbury</i> is the title of a recent English novel
(published by Harper and Brothers), which even
the opponents of fictitious literature must commend
for its elevated moral tendency, and its pure religious
spirit. It is free from the exaggerated views
of life, and the morbid, inflated sentiment which
form the staple of so many fashionable novels.
With its reserved and quiet tone, it may at first
disappoint the reader accustomed to a higher stimulus,
but its cool domestic pictures, its fine illustrations
of character, and its truthfulness and beauty
of feeling will win the admiration of the most intelligent
judges.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful books of the season
has been issued by J.S. Redfield, entitled <i>Episodes
of Insect Life</i>, with copious engravings illustrative
of the department of natural history to which it is
devoted. The anonymous author is a passionate
lover of nature, and describes the results of personal
observation in glowing and picturesque language.
Since the elaborate work of Kirby and Spence,
nothing has proceeded from the English press more
eminently adapted to inspire a taste for entomological
researches, or treating the curious phenomena
of insect economy with more animation and beauty
of style. The fruits of accurate investigation are
embellished with the charm of a lively fancy, making
a volume no less delightful than instructive.</p>

<p>Lippincott, Grambo, and Co. have commenced a
new serial publication, entitled <i>Arthur's Library
for the Household</i>, consisting of original tales and
sketches by <span class="smcap">T.S. Arthur</span>. The two volumes already
published contain <i>Woman's Trials</i> and <i>Married
Life</i>. They will speedily be followed by other
volumes, to the number of twelve, printed in uniform
style, and with great typographical neatness.
The chaste and elevated tone of Mr. Arthur's writings,
with his uncommon skill in describing the
scenes of real life, has deservedly made him a favorite
with a large class of readers, and will, we
have no doubt, guarantee a wide success to the
present publication.</p>

<p>A cheap edition of <span class="smcap">Arthur's</span> <i>Works</i> is now passing
through the press of T.B. Peterson, Phil., and
commands an extensive circulation. The last volume
issued is <i>The Banker's Wife</i>, a tale illustrative
of American society, and conveying an admirable
moral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The early days of June often exhibit the coyness
of her sister, May; and while the leaves are
broadly expanding, and the buds are every where
bursting into blossom, in full exuberance, cool
breezes from the North, or chilling vapors from the
East, sometimes remind those who are riding or
walking, of the breath of Winter. It is not safe
permanently to employ the thin dress fabrics of
flowing summer before the middle of the month.
Silks form the most suitable material for out-of-door
costume, and mantelets are more in vogue than the
gossamer-like shawls of July.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mantelets.</span>&mdash;Those composed of <i>glac&eacute;</i> silks are
greatly in favor, being of moderate size, loose, and
rather short; they have, nevertheless, a novel appearance,
the variety in their style depending greatly
upon their trimmings. The waist and shoulders
are gracefully marked. The principal trimmings
consist of frillings, or flounces, cut <i>falbalas</i> and
<i>passamenteries arachne&eacute;s</i>. These decorations are
intended principally for morning or demi-toilets,
those of a more full-dress description being trimmed
with a very deep fall of black lace, or two or
three frillings equally deep and ample.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dresses.</span>&mdash;Plain bodies, slightly stiffened, are
much in fashion. Those intended for pelisses are
of the waistcoat form, cut in the Amazonian shape,
somewhat like that seen in Figure 2 of our first
illustration. Among other elegant styles, is a <i>robe
&agrave; la myon</i> of gray taffeta, having the corsage
formed of narrow plaits, in style resembling that in
Figure 1 of the above illustration. It forms a kind
of fan back; in front, the folds are made deep upon
the top, and descend in a straight line toward the
lower part of the waist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 1 in our first illustration represents an
elegant style of <span class="smcap">Visiting Dress</span>. It is of light
blue silk; the skirt trimmed with three rather narrow
flounces, waved at the edge, and caught up in
a point up the centre of the front, where they are
each confined with a small <i>n&oelig;ud</i> of ribbon, the same
color of the dress. The high, close-fitting corsage
is entirely formed of narrow folds placed close together;
the opening up the front being concealed
by a fluting of ribbon, gradually narrowing toward
the lower part of the waist. Long plain sleeves,
ornamented round the top with a puffing of silk,
forming an epaulette. The sleeves are open up
the front of the arm as far as the bend, and caught
across at regular intervals, so as to admit of the
under full white sleeves showing through and forming
puffings. Bonnet of white silk or satin: the
exterior decorated with two white ostrich feathers,
and the interior with a wreath of white rose-buds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 2 in our first picture, represents a beautiful
<span class="smcap">Carriage Costume</span>. Plain high dress of
violet silk; the body fitting tight has a small jacket
trimmed round with a narrow <i>r&ucirc;che</i>. The body
opens in the front and has a fulling of white lace to
give the appearance of the frill of the habit shirt.
The sleeves are not very wide, and are three-quarters
length. They have cuffs cut in points,
turned back, and edges with a narrow <i>r&ucirc;che</i>. The
skirt is long and fall, trimmed with rosettes of ribbon,
from which hang two small tassels. <i>Mantilla</i>
of rich silk, trimmed with broad black lace, lined
with white silk. Bonnet of <i>paille de riz</i>, decorated
with splendid drooping flowers on the right, of a
primrose color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure</span> 3 shows a neat
style of head-dress for a
<span class="smcap">Morning Costume</span>, which
is composed of folds of ribbon,
partly covering a braid
of hair on one side. The
dress is high, edged with a
lace collar, with a ribbon
hanging in loops in front.
The sleeves in morning costumes
are generally very
wide from the elbow, three-quarters
length, and trimmed
to correspond. The
skirt is long and full, bias on
each side, the front breadth turned back; trimmed
with <i>guimpe</i>.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Bonnet.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnets</span> are generally of
white silk, formed in various
designs, decorated with different
sorts of violets and
lilacs of the most opposite
shades. They are very gay,
yet very simple. They are
generally somewhat small,
having the front rather open
at the sides, allowing the
hair to be arranged in full
bands, with becoming and
fanciful ears in the interior.
Figure 4 represents a bonnet
of white satin, covered
with two rows of white lace,
divided with a double row of fancy light green ribbon,
and decorated with white daisies in the interior.
Bonnets composed of <i>cr&egrave;pe</i> and <i>paille</i>, are decorated
with bunches of flowers composed of the wild violet,
with grass and delicate herbs. A very elegant
style of bonnet is composed partly of blonde and
fillings of light green <i>velours &eacute;pingl&eacute;</i>, ornamented
in a fanciful manner with marabouts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caps</span> are extremely pretty and light in appearance.
Some formed of inlet, relieved with drawings,
through which is passed a narrow satin ribbon,
and decorated with <i>coques</i>, placed sidewise,
are very pretty. A very charming style of morning
caps are those formed of muslin, surmounted with
four small <i>torsades</i> of lilac silk drooping over the
forehead, and encircling the ears. Upon each side
is placed a very large <i>n&oelig;ud</i> of silk, and at the back
two <i>rachons</i> of embroidered muslin, headed with
<i>torsades</i> of ribbon. Another style forms upon the
summit of the head, advancing a little in front, "&agrave;
la Marie Stuart," having three papillons of Brussels
point lace, divided with pink ribbons. On the sides
tufts of lace, and black and pink ribbons in corkscrews,
hanging low.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
